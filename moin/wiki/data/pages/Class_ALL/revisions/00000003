[[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]] is a gargantuan beast that's been wreaking havoc in the Zoo of late.



First [Aar04b] observed that PP/rpoly ([[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] with polynomial-size randomized advice) equals [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]], as does PostBQP/qpoly ([[Class_PostBQP|$\text{PostBQP}$]] with polynomial-size quantum advice).



Then [[ZooRefs#Raz05|[Raz05] ]] showed that QIP/qpoly, and even IP(2)/rpoly, equal [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]].



Nor is it hard to show that MA,,EXP,,/rpoly = [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]].



On the other hand, even though [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] contains [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]], and [[Class_EXPSPACE|$\text{EXPSPACE}$]] contains [[Class_MAEXP|$\text{MA}_\text{EXP}\text{}$]], it's easy to see that PSPACE/rpoly = [[Class_PSPACE/poly|$\text{PSPACE/poly}$]] and EXPSPACE/rpoly = EXPSPACE/poly are not [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]].



So does [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]] have no respect for complexity class inclusions at ALL?  (Sorry.)



It is not as contradictory as it first seems.  The deterministic base class in all of these examples is modified by computational non-determinism after it is modified by advice.  For example, MA,,EXP,,/rpoly means M(A,,EXP,,/rpoly), while (MA,,EXP,,)/rpoly equals MA,,EXP,,/poly by a standard argument.  In other words, it's only the verifier, not the prover or post-selector, who receives the randomized or quantum advice. The prover knows a description of the advice state, but not its measured values.  Modification by /rpoly does preserve class inclusions when it is applied after other changes.
