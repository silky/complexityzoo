== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in polynomial space.



Equals [[Class_NPSPACE|$\text{NPSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#Sav70|[Sav70] ]], [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] [[ZooRefs#CKS81|[CKS81] ]], [[Class_IP|$\text{IP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Sha90|[Sha90] ]], and, assuming the existence of one-way functions, [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] [[ZooRefs#BGG+90|[BGG+90] ]].



Contains [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] with [[Class_SharpP|$\text{#P}$]] oracle.



A canonical PSPACE-complete problem is QBF.



Relative to a random oracle, [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] strictly contains [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] with probability 1 [[ZooRefs#Cai86|[Cai86] ]].



[[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] has a complete problem that is both downward self-reducible and random self-reducible [[ZooRefs#TV02|[TV02] ]].  It is the largest class with such a complete problem.



Contained in [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].  There exists an oracle relative to which this containment is proper [[ZooRefs#Dek76|[Dek76] ]].



In descriptive complexity, [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] can be defined with 4 differents kind of formulae, FO() which is also [[Class_FO(PFP)|$\text{FO(PFP)}$]] and SO() which is also SO(TC).



A canonical PSPACE-complete problem is Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF): Given a Boolean formula with universal and existential quantifiers, decide whether it's true or false.
