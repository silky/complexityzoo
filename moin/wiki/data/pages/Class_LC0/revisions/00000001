= LC^0^ - Unbounded Fanin Linear Size Constant-Depth Circuits =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a nonuniform family of Boolean circuits, with linear size, constant depth and unbounded fanin.



It is equivalent to [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC0}$]] with bounded fanout and it is properly contained in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC0}$]] [[ZooRefs#CR96|[CR96] ]].
