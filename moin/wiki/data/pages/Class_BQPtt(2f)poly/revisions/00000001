== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_BQP/mpoly|$\text{BQP/mpoly}$]], except that the machine only gets to make nonadaptive queries to whatever oracle it might have.}}}

}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [NY03b], where it was also shown that [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] is not contained in [[Class_BQPtt/poly|$\text{BQP}_\text{tt}\text{/poly}$]] relative to an oracle.
