= W^*^[t] - W[t] With Parameter-Dependent Depth =

== Comments ==

Same as W[t], except that now the circuit depth can depend on the parameter k rather than being constant.  (The number of unbounded-fanin gates along any path to the root is still at most t.)

W^*^[1] = W[1] [DFT96], and W^*^[2] = W[2] [DF97], but the problem is open for larger t.
