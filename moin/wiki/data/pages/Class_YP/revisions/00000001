The class of decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time machine M such that:



For all input sizes n, there exists a polynomial-size advice string s,,n,, such that M(x,s,,n,,) outputs the correct answer for all inputs x of size n.

For all inputs x and advice strings s, M(x,s) outputs either the correct answer or "I don't know."



Defined in a recent post of the blog Shtetl-Optimized.  See there for an explanation of the class's name.



Contains [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] by the same argument that places [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]].



Also contains [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] with [[Class_TALLY|$\text{TALLY}$]] ∩ [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] ∩ [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]] oracle.



Is contained in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] ∩ [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]] and [[Class_YPP|$\text{YPP}$]].
