= YP - Your Polynomial-Time or Yaroslav-Percival =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time machine M such that:

For all input sizes n, there exists a polynomial-size advice string s,,n,, such that M(x,s,,n,,) outputs the correct answer for all inputs x of size n.
For all inputs x and advice strings s, M(x,s) outputs either the correct answer or "I don't know."

Defined in a recent post of the blog Shtetl-Optimized.  See there for an explanation of the class's name.

Contains ZPP by the same argument that places BPP in P/poly.

Also contains P with TALLY ∩ NP ∩ coNP oracle.

Is contained in NP ∩ coNP and YPP.
