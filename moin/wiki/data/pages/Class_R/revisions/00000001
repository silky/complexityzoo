The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine.  Often identified with the class of 'effectively computable' functions (the Church-Turing thesis).



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Tur36|[Tur36] ]], [[ZooRefs#Chu41|[Chu41] ]], and other seminal early papers.



Equals [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] âˆ© [[Class_coRE|$\text{coRE}$]].



Strictly contains [[Class_PR|$\text{PR}$]], the primitive recursive functions (see [[ZooRefs#Kle71|[Kle71] ]]).
