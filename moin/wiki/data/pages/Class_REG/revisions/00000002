{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by deterministic finite automata (DFAs).}}}

== Comments ==



Equals the class solvable by nondeterministic finite automata (NDFAs).



Equals DSPACE(O(1)) [[ZooRefs#She59|[She59] ]], which equals DSPACE(o(log log n)) [[ZooRefs#HLS65|[HLS65] ]].



Includes, i.e., "Is the parity of the input odd?," but not "Are the majority of bits in the input 1's?"  This is sometimes expressed as "finite automata can't count."



Contained in [[Class_NC1|$\text{NC}^\text{1}\text{}$]].



See e.g. [[ZooRefs#Koz97|[Koz97] ]], [[ZooRefs#Gur89|[Gur89] ]] for basic results on regular languages.
