The class of decision problems solvable by deterministic finite automata (DFAs).

Equals the class solvable by nondeterministic finite automata (NDFAs).

Equals DSPACE(O(1)) [She59], which equals DSPACE(o(log log n)) [HLS65].

Includes, i.e., "Is the parity of the input odd?," but not "Are the majority of bits in the input 1's?"  This is sometimes expressed as "finite automata can't count."

Contained in NC^1^.

See e.g. [Koz97], [Gur89] for basic results on regular languages.
