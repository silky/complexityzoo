The class of decision problems of the form (x,k), k a parameter, that are solvable in time f(k)p(|x|), where f is arbitrary and p is a polynomial.

The basic class of the theory of fixed-parameter tractability, as described by Downey and Fellows [DF99].

To separate FPT and W[2], one could show there is no proof system for CNF formulae that admits proofs of size f(k)n^O(1)^, where f is a computable function and n is the size of the formula.

Contained in FPT,,nu,,, W[1], and FPR.

Contains FPTAS [CC97], as well as FPT,,su,,.

Contains EPTAS unless FPT = W[1] [Baz95].
