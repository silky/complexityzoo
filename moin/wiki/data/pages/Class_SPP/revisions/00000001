The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that



If the answer is "no," then the number of accepting computation paths exactly equals the number of rejecting paths.

If the answer is "yes," then these numbers differ by 2.



(A technicality: If the total number of paths is even then the numbers can't differ by 1.)



Defined in [[ZooRefs#FFK94|[FFK94] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]] is low for [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]], [[Class_C=P|$\text{C=P}$]], [[Class_ModkP|$\text{ModkP}$]], and [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]] itself.  (I.e. adding [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]] as an oracle does not increase the power of these classes.)



Independently defined in [[ZooRefs#OH93|[OH93] ]], who called the class [[Class_XP|$\text{XP}$]].



Contained in [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]], [[Class_C=P|$\text{C=P}$]], and [[Class_WPP|$\text{WPP}$]] among other classes.



Contains [[Class_FewP|$\text{FewP}$]]; indeed, [[Class_FewP|$\text{FewP}$]] is low for [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]], so that SPP^FewP^ = [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#FFK94|[FFK94] ]].



Contains the problem of deciding whether a graph has any nontrivial automorphisms [[ZooRefs#KST92|[KST92] ]].



Indeed, contains graph isomorphism [[ZooRefs#AK02|[AK02] ]].



Contains a whole gaggle of problems for solvable black-box groups: solvability testing, membership testing, subgroup testing, normality testing, order verification, nilpotetence testing, group isomorphism, and group intersection [[ZooRefs#Vin04|[Vin04] ]]



[[ZooRefs#AK02|[AK02] ]] also showed that the Hidden Subgroup Problem for permutation groups, of interest in quantum computing, is in FP^SPP^.
