== Comments ==

The class of decision problems such that, for every n-bit string x, there exists a program A of size O(log n) that, given x as input, "correctly decides" the answer on x in time polynomial in n.  This means:

There exists a polynomial p such that for any input y, A returns either "yes", "no", or "I don't know" in time p(|y|).
Whenever A returns "yes" or "no", it is correct.
A returns either "yes" or "no" on x.

Defined in [OKS+94]; see also [LV97].

If NP is contained in IC[log,poly], then P = NP [OKS+94].  Indeed, any self-reducible problem in IC[log,poly] is also in P.

Strictly contains P/log, and is strictly contained in P/poly.
