== Description ==

{{{#!description

The set of problems that can be answered by a uniform family of polynomial-sized quantum circuits whose gates are drawn from a set [[Class_K|$\text{K}$]], and that return the correct answer with probability 1, and run in polynomial time with probability 1, and the allowed gates are drawn from a set [[Class_K|$\text{K}$]].  [[Class_K|$\text{K}$]] may be either finite or countable and enumerated.  If S is a ring, the union of [[Class_EQPK|$\text{EQP}_\text{K}\text{}$]] over all finite gate sets [[Class_K|$\text{K}$]] whose amplitudes are in the ring [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] can be written EQP,,S,,.}}}

Defined in [[ZooRefs#ADH97|[ADH97] ]] in the special case of a finite set of 1-qubit gates controlled by a second qubit.  It was shown there that transcendental gates may be replaced by algebraic gates without decreasing the size of [[Class_EQPK|$\text{EQP}_\text{K}\text{}$]].



[[ZooRefs#FR98|[FR98] ]] show that EQP,,Q,, is in [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]].  The proof can be generalized to any finite, algebraic gate set [[Class_K|$\text{K}$]].



The hidden shift problem for a vector space over Z/2 is in EQP,,Q,, by Simon's algorithm.  The discrete logarithm problem over Z/p is in EQP,,Q-bar,, using infinitely many gates [[ZooRefs#MZ03|[MZ03] ]].
