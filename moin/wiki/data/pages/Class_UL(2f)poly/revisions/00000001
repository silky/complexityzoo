= UL/poly - Nonuniform UL =

== Comments ==

Has the same relation to UL as P/poly does to P.

Equals NL/poly [RA00]. (A corollary is that UL/poly is closed under complement).

Note that in UL/poly, the witness must be unique even for bad advice. UL/mpoly (as in BQP/mpoly) is a more natural definition, but this is a moot distinction here because [RA00] show that they both equal NL/poly.
