{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]], but with f(n)-time (for some constructible function f) rather than polynomial-time machines.}}}

== Comments ==



The Nondeterministic Time Hierarchy Theorem: If f and g are time-constructible and f(n+1)=o(g), then NTIME(f(n)) does not equal NTIME(g(n)) [[ZooRefs#SFM78|[SFM78] ]] (this is actually stronger than the hierarchy theorem for DTIME).



NTIME(n) strictly contains DTIME(n) [[ZooRefs#PPS+83|[PPS+83] ]] (this result does not work for arbitrary f(n)).



For any constructible superpolynomial f, NTIME(f(n)) with [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] oracle is not in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] [[ZooRefs#Kan82|[Kan82] ]].
