The class of problems L that have a decider in the following sense.  There exists a BPP machine D such that for all inputs x,

If the answer is "yes" then D^L^(x) (D with oracle for L) accepts with probability at least 2/3.
If the answer is "no" then D^A^(x) accepts with probability at most 1/3 for all oracles A.

Contains compIP [BG94] and Check [BK89].

Contained in MIP = NEXP [FRS88].

Assuming NEE is not contained in BPEE, NP (and indeed NP âˆ© Coh) is not contained in frIP [BG94].
