= RG(1) - One-turn Refereed Games =

== Comments ==

The class of problems for which there exists a BPP machine M such that, on input x:

If the answer is 'yes,' then there exists a distribution Y such that for all distributions Z, M(x,Y,Z) accepts with probability at least 2/3.
If the answer is 'no,' then there exists a distribution Z such that for all distributions Y, M(x,Y,Z) rejects with probability at least 2/3.

In other words, it's the same as RG(k) for , the class of problems that admit interactive proofs with competing provers in which there's no communication from the verifier back to the provers.

RG(1) trivially contains S,,2,,P.  Indeed, RG(1) can be viewed as a randomized version of S,,2,,P.

RG(1) is trivially contained in RG(2) (and hence PSPACE).
