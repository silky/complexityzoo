The class of problems for which there exists a [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine M such that, on input x:



If the answer is 'yes,' then there exists a distribution Y such that for all distributions Z, M(x,Y,Z) accepts with probability at least 2/3.

If the answer is 'no,' then there exists a distribution Z such that for all distributions Y, M(x,Y,Z) rejects with probability at least 2/3.



In other words, it's the same as [[Class_RG(k)|$\text{RG(k)}$]] for , the class of problems that admit interactive proofs with competing provers in which there's no communication from the verifier back to the provers.



[[Class_RG(1)|$\text{RG(1)}$]] trivially contains [[Class_S2P|$\text{S2P}$]].  Indeed, [[Class_RG(1)|$\text{RG(1)}$]] can be viewed as a randomized version of [[Class_S2P|$\text{S2P}$]].



[[Class_RG(1)|$\text{RG(1)}$]] is trivially contained in [[Class_RG(2)|$\text{RG(2)}$]] (and hence PSPACE).
