If the answer is 'yes,' one or more computation paths accept.

If the answer is 'no,' all paths reject.

If the machine can make a nondeterministic transition from configuration A to configuration B, then it can also transition from B to A.  (This is what 'symmetric' means.)



Defined in [[ZooRefs#LP82|[LP82] ]].



The undirected s-t connectivity problem (USTCON: is there a path from vertex s to vertex t in a given undirected graph?) is complete for [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]], under L-reductions.



[[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] contains [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]], and is contained in [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].



It follows from [[ZooRefs#AKL+79|[AKL+79] ]] that [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] is contained in [[Class_L/poly|$\text{L/poly}$]].



[[ZooRefs#KW93|[KW93] ]] showed that [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] is contained in [[Class_⊕L|$\text{⊕L}$]], as well as [[Class_ModkL|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{L}$]] for every prime k.



[[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] is also contained in DSPACE(log^3/2^n) [[ZooRefs#NSW92|[NSW92] ]], and indeed in DSPACE(log^4/3^n) [[ZooRefs#ATW+00|[ATW+00] ]].



[[ZooRefs#NT95|[NT95] ]] showed that [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] equals [[Class_coSL|$\text{coSL}$]], and furthermore that SL^SL^ = [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] (that is, the symmetric logspace hierarchy collapses).



Reingold ultimately showed that [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] = [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] [[ZooRefs#Rei04|[Rei04] ]], even relative to an oracle. This subsumes many of the earlier results.



The reachability problem (is there a path from vertex s to vertex t?) for undirected graphs is complete for [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]], under L-reduction.



The story ends with the remarkable result that [[Class_SL|$\text{SL}$]] = [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] (even relative to an oracle)
