Same as AM, except that we allow polylog(n) rounds of interaction between Arthur and Merlin instead of a constant number.

Not much is known about AM[polylog] -- for example, whether it sits in PH.  However, [SS04] show that if AM[polylog] contains coNP, then EH collapses to S,,2,,-EXPâ€¢P^NP^.  ([PV04] improved the collapse to AM,,EXP,,.)
