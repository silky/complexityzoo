== Comments ==

[[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] equipped with an oracle that, given a string x, returns the length of the shortest program that outputs x.



A similar class was defined in [[ZooRefs#ABK+02|[ABK+02] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_PK|$\text{PK}$]] contains [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]].  It is not known whether [[Class_PK|$\text{PK}$]] contains all of [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]], or even any recursive problem not in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]].
