


= P^K^ - P With Kolmogorov-Complexity Oracle =

P equipped with an oracle that, given a string x, returns the length of the shortest program that outputs x.

A similar class was defined in [ABK+02], where it was also shown that P^K^ contains PSPACE.  It is not known whether P^K^ contains all of R, or even any recursive problem not in PSPACE.
