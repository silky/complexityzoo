== Comments ==

We define second-order variable  has got an arity k and represent any proposition of arity . They are usually written in upper-case.

Second order logic is the set of FO formulae where we add quantification over second-order variables.

Every formuale is equivalent to a formulae in prenex normal form, where we first write quantification on variable on second order and then a FO-formulae in prenex normal form.

In Descriptive complexity we can see that SO is equal to PH, more precisely we have that formulae in prenex normal form where existantial and universal of second order alternate k times are the kth level of the polynomial hierarchy.

This means that SO with only existantial second-order quantification is equal to  which is NP, and with only universal quantification is equal to  which is Co-NP.
