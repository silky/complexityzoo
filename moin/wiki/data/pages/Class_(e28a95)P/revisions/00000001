The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

If the answer is 'yes,' then the number of accepting paths is odd.
If the answer is 'no,' then the number of accepting paths is even.

Defined in [PZ83].

Contains graph isomorphism; indeed, graph isomorphism is low for ⊕P [AK02].

Contains FewP [CH89].

There exists an oracle relative to which P = ⊕P but P is not equal to NP (and indeed NP = EXP) [BBF98].

Equals Mod,,2^m,,P for every positive integer m.
