The union of NE, NP^NE^, NP^NP^NE^, and so on.

Is called "strong" to contrast it with the ordinary Exponential Hierarchy EH.

Note that we would get the same class if we replaced NE by NEXP.

SEH collapses to P^NE^ [Hem89]

There exists an oracle relative to which SEH is not contained in EH [Hem89].
EH and SEH are incomparable for all anyone knows.
