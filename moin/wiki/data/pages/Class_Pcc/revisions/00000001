== Description ==

{{{#!description

In a two-party communication complexity problem, Alice and Bob have n-bit strings x and y respectively, and they wish to evaluate some Boolean function f(x,y) using as few bits of communication as possible.  [[Class_Pcc|$\text{P}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] is the class of (infinite families of) f's, such that the amount of communication needed is only O(polylog(n)), even if Alice and Bob are restricted to a deterministic protocol.}}}

== Comments ==



Note that all functions of the form above are solvable given $O(n)$ bits of communication, since no bounds are placed on the computational abilities of Alice and Bob. Thus, when discussing this class, "polynomially" is sometimes used in place of "polylogarithmically."



Is strictly contained in [[Class_NPcc|$\text{NP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] and in [[Class_BPPcc|$\text{BPP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] because of the EQUALITY problem.



Equals [[Class_NPcc|$\text{NP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] âˆ© [[Class_coNPcc|$\text{coNP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]].
