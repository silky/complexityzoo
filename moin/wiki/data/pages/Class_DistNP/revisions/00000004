A distributional problem consists of a decision problem A, and a probability distribution μ over problem instances.



(A,μ) is in [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] if A is in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]], and μ is P-computable (meaning that its cumulative density function can be evaluated in polynomial time).



[[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] has complete problems [[ZooRefs#Lev86|[Lev86] ]] (see also [[ZooRefs#Gur87|[Gur87] ]]), although unlike for [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] this is not immediate.



Any DistNP-complete problem is also complete for (NP,P-samplable) [[ZooRefs#IL90|[IL90] ]].



[[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] has complete problems [[ZooRefs#Gur87|[Gur87] ]], although unlike for [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] this is not immediate.
