(also called (NP,P-computable) or RNP)

A distributional problem consists of a decision problem A, and a probability distribution μ over problem instances.

(A,μ) is in DistNP if A is in NP, and μ is P-computable (meaning that its cumulative density function can be evaluated in polynomial time).

DistNP has complete problems [Lev86] (see also [Gur87]), although unlike for NP this is not immediate.

Any DistNP-complete problem is also complete for (NP,P-samplable) [IL90].

DistNP has complete problems [Gur87], although unlike for NP this is not immediate.
