Δ,,i,,P = [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] with Σ,,i-1,,P oracle.

Σ,,i,,P = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] with Σ,,i-1,,P oracle.

Π,,i,,P = [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]] with Σ,,i-1,,P oracle.



Then [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] is the union of these classes for all nonnegative constant i.



[[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] can also be defined using alternating quantifiers: it's the class of problems of the form, "given an input x, does there exist a y such that for all z, there exists a w ... such that φ(x,y,z,w,...)," where y,z,w,... are polynomial-size strings and φ is a polynomial-time computable predicate.  It's not totally obvious that this is equivalent to the first definition, since the first one involves adaptive [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] oracle queries and the second one doesn't, but it is.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Sto76|[Sto76] ]].



Contained in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] with a [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] oracle [[ZooRefs#Tod89|[Tod89] ]].



Contains [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Lau83|[Lau83] ]].



Relative to a random oracle, [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] with probability 1 [[ZooRefs#Cai86|[Cai86] ]].



Furthermore, there exist oracles separating any Σ,,i,,P from Σ,,i+1,,P.  On the other hand, it is unknown whether Σ,,i,,P is strictly contained in Σ,,i+1,,P relative to a random oracle with probability 1 (see [[ZooRefs#Has87|[Has87] ]]).  Book [[ZooRefs#Boo94|[Boo94] ]] shows that if [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] collapses relative to a random oracle with probability 1, then it collapses unrelativized.



It was shown in [CPO7] that if the [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] Machine Hypothesis holds, then

$

    \mathsf{P}^{\mathrm{SAT}[1]} = \mathsf{P}^{\mathrm{SAT}[2]} \Rightarrow \mathsf{PH} \subseteq \mathsf{NP}

$.



For a compendium of problems complete for different classes of the Polynomial Hierarchy see [Sch02a] and [Sch02b].



[[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] is equal to the set of boolean queries recognizable by a concurent random acess machine using exponentially many processors and constant time[[ZooRefs#Imm89|[Imm89] ]].



Since [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is the class of query expressible in second-order existantial logic, [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] can also be defined as the query expressible in second-order logic.
