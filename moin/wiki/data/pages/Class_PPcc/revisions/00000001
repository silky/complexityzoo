== Comments ==

Defined in [[ZooRefs#BFS86|[BFS86] ]], [[Class_PPcc|$\text{PPcc}$]] is one of two ways to define a communication complexity analogue of [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]]. In [[Class_PPcc|$\text{PPcc}$]], we note that in an algorithm that uses an amount of random bits bounded by , the bias between the accept and reject probabilities can be no smaller than . Thus, in [[Class_PPcc|$\text{PPcc}$]], the communication complexity is defined as the sum of the traditional communication complexity (the number of exchanged bits) and the log of the reciprocal of the worst-case (smallest) bias.



The difference between this class and [[Class_UPPcc|$\text{UPPcc}$]] is discussed further in [[ZooRefs#BVW07|[BVW07] ]], where it is shown that [[Class_PPcc|$\text{PPcc}$]] âŠ‚ [[Class_UPPcc|$\text{UPPcc}$]].
