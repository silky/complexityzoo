== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of problems in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] whose witnesses are in [[Class_FBQP|$\text{FBQP}$]].  For example, the set of square-free numbers is in coRBQP using only the fact that factoring is in [[Class_FBQP|$\text{FBQP}$]].  (Even without a proof that the factors are prime, the factorization proves that there is a square divisor.)}}}

Contains [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] and [[Class_ZBQP|$\text{ZBQP}$]], and is contained in [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] and [[Class_RQP|$\text{RQP}$]].  Defined here to clarify [[Class_EQP|$\text{EQP}$]]; see also [[Class_ZBQP|$\text{ZBQP}$]].
