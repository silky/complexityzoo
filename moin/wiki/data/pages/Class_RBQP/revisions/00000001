= RBQP - Strict Quantum RP =

== Comments ==

The class of problems in NP whose witnesses are in FBQP.  For example, the set of square-free numbers is in coRBQP using only the fact that factoring is in FBQP.  (Even without a proof that the factors are prime, the factorization proves that there is a square divisor.)

Contains RP and ZBQP, and is contained in BQP and RQP.  Defined here to clarify EQP; see also ZBQP.
