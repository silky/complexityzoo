== Description ==

{{{#!description

Similar to [[Class_TreeBQP|$\text{TreeBQP}$]] except that the quantum computer's state at each time step is restricted to being exponentially close to a state in AmpP (that is, a state for which the amplitudes are computable by a classical polynomial-size circuit).}}}

Defined in [Aar03b], where it was also observed that [[Class_AmpP-BQP|$\text{AmpP-BQP}$]] is contained in the third level of [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]], just as [[Class_TreeBQP|$\text{TreeBQP}$]] is.
