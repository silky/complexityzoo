Same as [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]], except now Arthur is [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] instead of polynomial-time, and the message from Merlin can be exponentially long.}}}

There is a problem in [[Class_MAEXP|$\text{MA}_\text{EXP}\text{}$]] that does not have polynomial-size circuits [[ZooRefs#BFT98|[BFT98] ]].  On the other hand, there is an oracle relative to which every problem in [[Class_MAEXP|$\text{MA}_\text{EXP}\text{}$]] does have polynomial-size circuits.



[[ZooRefs#MVW99|[MVW99] ]] considered the best circuit lower bound obtainable for a problem in [[Class_MAEXP|$\text{MA}_\text{EXP}\text{}$]], using current techniques.  They found that this bound is half-exponential: i.e. a function f such that f(f(n))=2^n^.  Such functions exist, but are not expressible using standard asymptotic notation.
