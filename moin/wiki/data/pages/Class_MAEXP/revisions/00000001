Same as MA, except now Arthur is EXP instead of polynomial-time, and the message from Merlin can be exponentially long.

There is a problem in MA,,EXP,, that does not have polynomial-size circuits [BFT98].  On the other hand, there is an oracle relative to which every problem in MA,,EXP,, does have polynomial-size circuits.

[MVW99] considered the best circuit lower bound obtainable for a problem in MA,,EXP,,, using current techniques.  They found that this bound is half-exponential: i.e. a function f such that f(f(n))=2^n^.  Such functions exist, but are not expressible using standard asymptotic notation.
