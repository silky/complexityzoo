== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]], except we are promised that each existential quantifier has at most one 'yes' path, and each universal quantifier has at most one 'no' path.



Contains [[Class_UP|$\text{UP}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#NR98|[NR98] ]], where it was also shown that, even though [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]], it is unlikely that the same is true for [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]], since [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]] is contained in [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]].



[[ZooRefs#CGR+04|[CGR+04] ]] have also shown that UAP^UAP^ = [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]], and that [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]] contains Graph Isomorphism problem.



[[ZooRefs#CGR+04|[CGR+04] ]] have also shown that UAP^UAP^ = [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]], and that [[Class_UAP|$\text{UAP}$]] contains the Graph Isomorphism problem.
