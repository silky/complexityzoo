AC^i^ is the class of decision problems solvable by a nonuniform family of Boolean circuits, with polynomial size, depth O(log^i^(n)), and unbounded fanin.  The gates allowed are AND, OR, and NOT.

Then AC is the union of AC^i^ over all nonnegative i.

AC^i^ is contained in NC^i+1^; thus, AC = NC.

Contains NL.

For a random oracle A, (AC^i^)^A^ is strictly contained in (AC^i+1^)^A^, and (uniform) AC^A^ is strictly contained in P^A^, with probability 1 [Mil92].

fo-uniform AC with depth  is equal to FO[]
