Same as BPP, except that the random bit source is biased as follows.  Each bit could depend on all the previous bits in arbitrarily complicated ways; the only promise is that the bit is 1 with probability in the range [δ,1-δ], conditioned on all previous bits.

So clearly 0-BPP = P and 1/2-BPP = BPP.

It turns out that, for any δ>0, δ-BPP = BPP [VV85], [Zuc91].
