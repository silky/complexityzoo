== Comments ==

[[Class_SO[TC]|$\text{SO[TC]}$]] is to [[Class_SO|$\text{SO}$]] what FO[TC] is to [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]]. The TC operator can now also take second-order variable as argument.



In Descriptive complexity we can see that :

[[Class_SO[TC]|$\text{SO[TC]}$]] is  equal to [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]].
