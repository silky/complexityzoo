The class of Boolean functions f:{-1,1}^n^->{-1,1} such that the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of f is bounded by a polynomial in n.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BS90|[BS90] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_PL1|$\text{PL1}$]] is contained in [[Class_PT1|$\text{PT1}$]] (and this inclusion is strict).
