The class of problems for which there exists a polynomial-time predicate P(x,y,z) such that for all x, if the answer on input x is "yes," then

For all y, there exists a z for which P(x,y,z).
For all z, there exists a y for which P(x,y,z).

Contained in Σ,,2,,P and Π,,2,,P.

Defined in [Can96], where it was also observed that Φ,,2,,P = S,,2,,P.
