(Named in honor of Nick Pippenger.)

NC^i^ is the class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of Boolean circuits, with polynomial size, depth O(log^i^(n)), and fan-in 2.

Then NC is the union of NC^i^ over all nonnegative i.

Also, NC equals the union of PT/WK(log^k^n, n^k^)/poly over all constants k.

NC^i^ is contained in AC^i^; thus, NC = AC.

Contains NL.

Generalizations include RNC and QNC.

[IN96] construct a candidate pseudorandom generator in NC based on the subset sum problem.

For a random oracle A, (NC^i^)^A^ is strictly contained in (NC^i+1^)^A^, and uniform NC^A^ is strictly contained in P^A^, with probability 1 [Mil92].

In descriptive complexity, NC can be defined by FO[]
