NC^i^ is the class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of Boolean circuits, with polynomial size, depth O(log^i^(n)), and fan-in 2.



Then [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] is the union of NC^i^ over all nonnegative i.



Also, [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] equals the union of PT/WK(log^k^n, n^k^)/poly over all constants k.



NC^i^ is contained in AC^i^; thus, [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] = [[Class_AC|$\text{AC}$]].



Contains [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].



Generalizations include [[Class_RNC|$\text{RNC}$]] and [[Class_QNC|$\text{QNC}$]].



[[ZooRefs#IN96|[IN96] ]] construct a candidate pseudorandom generator in [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] based on the subset sum problem.



For a random oracle A, (NC^i^)^A^ is strictly contained in (NC^i+1^)^A^, and uniform NC^A^ is strictly contained in P^A^, with probability 1 [[ZooRefs#Mil92|[Mil92] ]].



In descriptive complexity, [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] can be defined by FO[ \log(n)^{O(1)}]



NC^i^ is the class of decision problems solvable by a nonuniform family of Boolean circuits, with polynomial size, depth O(log^i^(n)), and fan-in 2.
