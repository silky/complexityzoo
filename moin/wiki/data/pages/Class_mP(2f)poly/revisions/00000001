== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a nonuniform family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits with only AND and OR gates, no NOT gates.  (Or rather, following the definitions of [GS90], the entire input can be negated as long as there are no other negations.)

More straightforward to define than mP.
