The class of decision problems solvable by a nonuniform family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits with only AND and OR gates, no NOT gates.  (Or rather, following the definitions of [[ZooRefs#GS90|[GS90] ]], the entire input can be negated as long as there are no other negations.)



More straightforward to define than [[Class_mP|$\text{mP}$]].
