== Comments ==



Given an input x and a polynomial-time predicate F(x,y), output any y satisfying F(x,y).  (Such a y is promised to exist.)



Can be considered as the functional analogue of [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] âˆ© [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]]. Defined in [[ZooRefs#MP91|[MP91] ]].



Contained in [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]].



Subclasses include [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]], [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]], and [[Class_PLS|$\text{PLS}$]].
