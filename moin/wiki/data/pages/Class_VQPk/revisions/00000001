Has the same relation to [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]] as [[Class_QP|$\text{QP}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



Originated in [Val79b].



The determinant of an n-by-n matrix of indeterminates is VQP,,k,,-complete under a type of reduction called qp-projections (see [[ZooRefs#Bur00|[Bur00] ]] for example).  It is an open problem whether the determinant is VP,,k,,-complete.
