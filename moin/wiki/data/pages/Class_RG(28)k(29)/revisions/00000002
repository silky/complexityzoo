== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]], except that now the verifier exchanges exactly k messages with each prover where k is a polynomial-bounded function of the input length. Messages are exchanged in parallel.  By definition, RG(poly) = [[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]]. See also RG(1) and RG(2).}}}

== Comments ==



Other than trivial bounds, very little is known of RG(k) for intermediate values of k. For example, does RG(k) = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] for each constant $k\geq 2$?
