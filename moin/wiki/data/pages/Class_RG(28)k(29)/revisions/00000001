Same as [[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]], except that now the verifier exchanges exactly k messages with each prover where k is a polynomial-bounded function of the input length. Messages are exchanged in parallel.  By definition, RG(poly) = [[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]]. See also [[Class_RG(1)|$\text{RG(1)}$]] and [[Class_RG(2)|$\text{RG(2)}$]].



Other than trivial bounds, very little is known of [[Class_RG(k)|$\text{RG(k)}$]] for intermediate values of k. For example, does [[Class_RG(k)|$\text{RG(k)}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] for each constant ?
