Same as RG, except that now the verifier exchanges exactly k messages with each prover where k is a polynomial-bounded function of the input length. Messages are exchanged in parallel.  By definition, RG(poly) = RG. See also RG(1) and RG(2).

Other than trivial bounds, very little is known of RG(k) for intermediate values of k. For example, does RG(k) = PSPACE for each constant ?
