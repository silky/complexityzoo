The class of decision problems for which a 'yes' answer can be verified by a Turing machine in a finite amount of time.  (If the answer is 'no,' on the other hand, the machine might never halt.)}}}

Equivalently, the class of decision problems for which a Turing machine can list all the 'yes' instances, one by one (this is what 'enumerable' means).



A problem C is complete for [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] if (1) C is in [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] and (2) any problem in [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] can be reduced to C by a Turing machine.



Actually there are two types of reduction: M-reductions (for many-one), in which a single instance of the original problem is mapped to an instance of C, and T-reductions (for Turing), in which an algorithm for the original problem can make arbitrarily many calls to an oracle for C.



RE-complete sets are also called creative sets for some reason.



The canonical RE-complete problem is the halting problem: i.e., given a Turing machine, does it halt when started on a blank tape?



The famous unsolvability of the halting problem [[ZooRefs#Tur36|[Tur36] ]] implies that [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] does not equal [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]].



Also, [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] does not equal [[Class_coRE|$\text{coRE}$]].



[[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] and [[Class_coRE|$\text{coRE}$]] can be generalized to the arithmetic hierarchy [[Class_AH|$\text{AH}$]].



There are problems in [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] that are neither RE-complete under T-reductions, nor in [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] [[ZooRefs#Fri57|[Fri57] ]] [[ZooRefs#Muc56|[Muc56] ]].  This is the resolution of Post's problem [[ZooRefs#Pos44|[Pos44] ]].



Indeed, [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] contains infinitely many nonequivalent 'T-degrees.'  (A T-degree is a class of problems, all of which can be T-reduced to one another.)  The structure of the T-degrees has been studied in more detail than you can possibly imagine [[ZooRefs#Sho99|[Sho99] ]].
