The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

If the answer is 'no,' then all computation paths reject.
If the answer is 'yes,' then at least one path accepts; furthermore, the number of accepting paths is upper-bounded by a polynomial in n, the size of the input.

Defined in [AR88].

Is contained in âŠ•P [CH89].

There exists an oracle relative to which P, UP, FewP, and NP are all distinct [Rub88].

Also, there exists an oracle relative to which FewP does not have a Turing-complete set [HJV93].

Contained in Few.
