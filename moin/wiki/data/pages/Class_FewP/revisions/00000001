== Comments ==



If the answer is 'no,' then all computation paths reject.

If the answer is 'yes,' then at least one path accepts; furthermore, the number of accepting paths is upper-bounded by a polynomial in n, the size of the input.

Is contained in [[Class_⊕P|$\text{⊕P}$]] [[ZooRefs#CH89|[CH89] ]].



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], [[Class_UP|$\text{UP}$]], [[Class_FewP|$\text{FewP}$]], and [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] are all distinct [[ZooRefs#Rub88|[Rub88] ]].



Also, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_FewP|$\text{FewP}$]] does not have a Turing-complete set [[ZooRefs#HJV93|[HJV93] ]].



Contained in [[Class_Few|$\text{Few}$]].
