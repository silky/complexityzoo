== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] with access to two sets of qubits: causality-respecting qubits and CTC qubits.



Defined in [Aar05c], where it was shown that [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] is contained in [[Class_BQPCTC|$\text{BQPCTC}$]], which in turn is contained in [[Class_SQG|$\text{SQG}$]].
