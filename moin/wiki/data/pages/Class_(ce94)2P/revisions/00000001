== Comments ==

A level of PH, the polynomial hierarchy.

Contains BH.

There exists an oracle relative to which Δ,,2,,P is not contained in PP [Bei94].

There exists another oracle relative to which Δ,,2,,P is contained in P/poly [BGS75], and indeed has linear-size circuits [Wil85].

There exists an oracle B for which BPP^B^ is exponentially more powerful than Δ,,2,,P^B^ [KV96].

If P = NP, then any polynomial-size circuit C can be learned in Δ,,2,,P with C oracle [Aar06].
