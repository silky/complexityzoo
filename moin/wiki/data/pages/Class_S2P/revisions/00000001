= S,,2,,P - Second Level of the Symmetric Hierarchy =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which there is a polynomial-time predicate P such that, on input x,

If the answer is 'yes,' then there exists a y such that for all z, P(x,y,z) is true.
If the answer is 'no,' then there exists a z such that for all y, P(x,y,z) is false.

Note that this differs from Σ,,2,,P in that the quantifiers in the second condition are reversed.

Less formally, S,,2,,P is the class of one-round games in which a prover and a disprover submit simultaneous moves to a deterministic, polynomial-time referee.  In Σ,,2,,P, the disprover moves first.

Defined in [RS98], where it was also shown that S,,2,,P contains MA and Δ,,2,,P.  Defined independently in [Can96].

Contained in ZPP^NP^ [Cai01].

S,,2,,-EXP•P^NP^: Don't Ask 
One of the caged classes of the Complexity Zoo.
Has been implicated in a collapse scandal involving AM[polylog], coNP, and EH.
