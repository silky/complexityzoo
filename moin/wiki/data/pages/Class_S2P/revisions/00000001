{{{#!description

The class of decision problems for which there is a polynomial-time predicate [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] such that, on input x,}}}

If the answer is 'yes,' then there exists a y such that for all z, P(x,y,z) is true.

If the answer is 'no,' then there exists a z such that for all y, P(x,y,z) is false.



Note that this differs from [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] in that the quantifiers in the second condition are reversed.



Less formally, [[Class_S2P|$\text{S}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] is the class of one-round games in which a prover and a disprover submit simultaneous moves to a deterministic, polynomial-time referee.  In [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]], the disprover moves first.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#RS98|[RS98] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_S2P|$\text{S}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] contains [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] and [[Class_Δ2P|$\text{Δ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]].  Defined independently in [[ZooRefs#Can96|[Can96] ]].



Contained in ZPP^NP^ [[ZooRefs#Cai01|[Cai01] ]].



[[Class_S2-EXP•PNP|$\text{S}_\text{2}\text{-EXP•P}^\text{NP}\text{}$]]: Don't Ask 

One of the caged classes of the Complexity Zoo.

Has been implicated in a collapse scandal involving [[Class_AM[polylog]|$\text{AM[polylog]}$]], [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]], and [[Class_EH|$\text{EH}$]].
