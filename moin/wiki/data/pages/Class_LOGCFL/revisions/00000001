== Comments ==

The class of decision problems reducible in L to the problem of deciding membership in a context-free language.

Equivalently, LOGCFL is the class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of AC^1^ circuits, in which no AND gate has fan-in exceeding 2 (see e.g. [Joh90], p. 137).

LOGCFL is closed under complement [BCD+89].

Contains NL [Sud78].
