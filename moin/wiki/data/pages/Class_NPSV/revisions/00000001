= NPSV - NP Single Value =

== Comments ==

The class of [[Class_NPMV|$\text{NPMV}$]] functions that are single-valued (i.e., such that every accepting path outputs the same value).



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BLS84|[BLS84] ]].



Contains [[Class_NPSVt|$\text{NPSVt}$]].



[[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] if and only if [[Class_FP|$\text{FP}$]] = [[Class_NPSV|$\text{NPSV}$]].
