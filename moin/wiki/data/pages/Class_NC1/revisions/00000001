See NC for definition.

[KV94] give a family of functions that is computable in NC^1^, but not efficiently learnable unless there exists an efficient algorithm for factoring Blum integers.

Was shown to equal 5-PBP [Bar89].  On the other hand, width 5 is necessary unless NC^1^ = ACC^0^ [BT88].

As an application of this result, NC^1^ can be simulated on a quantum computer with three qubits, one initialized to a pure state and the remaining two in the maximally mixed state [ASV00].  Surprisingly, [AMP02] showed that only a single qubit is needed to simulate NC^1^ - i.e. that NC^1^ is contained in 2-EQBP.  (Complex amplitudes are needed for this result.)

Is contained in L [Bor77].

Contains TC^0^.

NC^1^ contains the integer division problem [BCH86], even if an L-uniformity condition is imposed [CDL01].

U,,E^*^,,-uniform NC^1^ is equal to ALOGTIME [RUZ81].
