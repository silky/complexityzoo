== Comments ==

[[Class_FO(DTC)|$\text{FO(DTC)}$]] is defined as FO(tc) where the transitive closure operator is deterministic, which means that when we apply DTC(), we know that for all , there exist at most one  such that phi(u,v).



We can suppose that DTC() is syntactic sugar for TC() where .



It was shown in [[ZooRefs#Imm99|[Imm99] ]] page 144 that this class is equal to [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]].
