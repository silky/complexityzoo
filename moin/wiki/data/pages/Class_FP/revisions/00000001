== Comments ==

Sometimes defined as the class of functions computable in polynomial time by a Turing machine.  (Generalizes [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], which is defined in terms of decision problems only.)



However, if we want to compare [[Class_FP|$\text{FP}$]] to [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]], we should instead define it as the class of [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]] problems (that is, polynomial-time predicates P(x,y)) for which there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that, given x, outputs any y such that P(x,y).  That is, there could be more than one valid output, even though any given algorithm only returns one of them.



[[Class_FP|$\text{FP}$]] = [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]] if and only if [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].



If FP^NP^ = [[Class_FPNP[log]|$\text{FPNP[log]}$]] (that is, allowed only a logarithmic number of queries), then [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Kre88|[Kre88] ]].  The corresponding result for [[Class_PNP|$\text{PNP}$]] versus [[Class_PNP[log]|$\text{PNP[log]}$]] is not known, and indeed fails relative to some oracles (see [Har87b]).
