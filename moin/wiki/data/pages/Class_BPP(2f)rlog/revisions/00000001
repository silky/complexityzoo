The class of problems solvable by a syntactic BPP machine with O(log n) random advice bits whose probability distribution depends only on the input length n.  For each n, there exists good advice such that the output is correct with probability at least 2/3.

Contains BPP/mlog.  The inclusion is strict, because BPP/rlog contains any finitely sparse language by fingerprinting; see the discussion for ALL.

Contained in BPP//log.
