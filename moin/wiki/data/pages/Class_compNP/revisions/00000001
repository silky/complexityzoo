The class of decision problems L in NP such that, if the answer is "yes," then a proof can be constructed in polynomial time given access only to an oracle for L.

Contains NPC.

[BG94] show that compNP is contained in frIP, and that assuming NEE is not contained in BPEE, compNP does not equal NP.
