== Description ==

{{{#!description

Has the same relation to [[Class_QSZK|$\text{QSZK}$]] as [[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] does to [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]].}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Kob02|[Kob02] ]], where it was also shown that the following promise problem is complete for [[Class_NIQSZK|$\text{NIQSZK}$]].  Given a quantum circuit, we are promised that the state it prepares (when run on the all-0 state, and tracing out non-output qubits) has trace distance either at most 1/3 or at least 2/3 from the maximally mixed state. The problem is to output "no" in the former case and "yes" in the latter.



NIQPZK can be defined similarly.
