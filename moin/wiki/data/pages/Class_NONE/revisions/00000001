= NONE - The Empty Class =

== Comments ==

The class that does not contain any languages.  (It might not surprise you that I put this one in at the suggestion of a mathematician...)



Is the opposite of [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]], but does not equal the complement coALL = [[Class_ALL|$\text{ALL}$]].



Is closed under polynomial-time Turing reductions :-).



Equals [[Class_SPARSE|$\text{SPARSE}$]] ∩ [[Class_coSPARSE|$\text{coSPARSE}$]] and [[Class_TALLY|$\text{TALLY}$]] ∩ coTALLY.
