The class of function problems of the following form:

Given an input x and a polynomial-time predicate F(x,y), if there exists a y satisfying F(x,y) then output any such y, otherwise output 'no.'

FNP generalizes NP, which is defined in terms of decision problems only.

Actually the word "function" is misleading, since there could be many valid outputs y.  That's unavoidable, since given a predicate F there's no "syntactic" criterion ensuring that y is unique.

FP = FNP if and only if P = NP.

Contains TFNP.

A basic question about FNP problems is whether they're self-reducible; that is, whether they reduce to the corresponding NP decision problems.  Although this is true for all NPC problems, [BG94] shows that if EE does not equal NEE, then there is a problem in NP such that no corresponding FNP problem can be reduced to it.  [BG94] cites Impagliazzo and Sudan as giving the same conclusion under the assumption that NE does not equal coNE.
