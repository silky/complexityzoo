Complement of [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]].



Along with [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]], comprises the second level of [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]], the polynomial hierarchy. For any fixed k, there is a problem in [[Class_Π2P|$\text{Π2P}$]] ∩ [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]] that cannot be solved by circuits of size n^k^ [[ZooRefs#Kan82|[Kan82] ]].
