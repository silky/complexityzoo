Defined in [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]] as the class of languages corresponding to fixed templates (where a template is a set of allowed constraints on values and variables) in the general Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Under this construction, 3SAT may be expressed as the fixed template (over the alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$) containing $C_0, C_1, C_2, C_3$:}}}

$\egin{matrix}

    C_0 & = & \\{0,1\\}^3 \ackslash (0,0,0) \\\

    C_1 & = & \\{0,1\\}^3 \ackslash (1,0,0) \\\

    C_2 & = & \\{0,1\\}^3 \ackslash (1,1,0) \\\

    C_3 & = & \\{0,1\\}^3 \ackslash (1,1,1)

\\end{matrix}$



For example, a 3SAT clause $(x \
ee y \
ee \
eg z)$ is represented in the [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]] construction as $C_1(z, x, y) \\in I$. By similar constructions, any k-SAT problem can be seen to be in [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]]. The class also includes Graph k-Coloring (for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$), Graph H-Coloring (for some graph $H$) and Linear Programming mod $q$.



In [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]], where the class is defined, the authors show that every problem in [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] is reducible under randomized polynomial-time reductions to a problem in [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]].
