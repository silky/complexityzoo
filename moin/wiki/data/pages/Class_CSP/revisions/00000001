Defined in [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]] as the class of languages corresponding to fixed templates (where a template is a set of allowed constraints on values and variables) in the general Constraint Satisfaction Problem. Under this construction, 3SAT may be expressed as the fixed template (over the alphabet ) containing :



For example, a 3SAT clause  is represented in the [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]] construction as . By similar constructions, any k-SAT problem can be seen to be in [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]]. The class also includes Graph k-Coloring (for ), Graph H-Coloring (for some graph ) and Linear Programming mod .



In [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]], where the class is defined, the authors show that every problem in [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] is reducible under randomized polynomial-time reductions to a problem in [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]].
