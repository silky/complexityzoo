{{{#!description
The SAT problem is to decide whether a given Boolean formula has any satisfying truth assignments. SAT is in NP, since a "yes" answer can be proved by just exhibiting a satisfying assignment. 

For some natural number $k$, an instance of k-SAT is an instance of SAT in conjunctive normal form (CNF) where all clauses are the logical OR of $k$ Boolean variables.
