The class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a quantum Turing machine, with at most 1/3 probability of error.

One can equivalently define BQP as the class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of polynomial-size quantum circuits, with at most 1/3 probability of error [Yao93].  Any universal gate set can be used as a basis; however, a technicality is that the transition amplitudes must be efficiently computable, since otherwise one could use them to encode the solutions to hard problems (see [ADH97]).

BQP is often identified as the class of feasible problems for quantum computers.

Contains the factoring and discrete logarithm problems [Sho97], the hidden Legendre symbol problem [DHI02], the Pell's equation and principal ideal problems [Hal02], and some other problems not thought to be in BPP.

Defined in [BV97], where it is also shown that BQP contains BPP and is contained in P with a #P oracle.

BQP^BQP^ = BQP [BV97].

[ADH97] showed that BQP is contained in PP, and [FR98] showed that BQP is contained in AWPP.

There exist oracles relative to which:

BQP does not equal to BPP [BV97] (and by similar arguments, is not in P/poly).
BQP is not contained in MA [Wat00].
BQP is not contained in Mod,,p,,P for prime p [GV02].
NP, and indeed NP ∩ coNP, are not contained in BQP  with probability 1 relative to a random oracle and a random permutation oracle, respectively [BBB+97].
SZK is not contained in BQP [Aar02].
BQP is not contained in SZK (follows easily using the quantum walk problem in [CCD+03]).
PPAD is not contained in BQP [Li11].

BQP does not equal BPP [BV97] (and by similar arguments, is not in P/poly).

BQP is not contained in Mod,,p,,P for prime p [GV02].
NP, and indeed NP ∩ coNP, are not contained in BQP (in fact, this holds with probability 1 relative to a random oracle and a random permutation oracle, respectively) [BBB+97].
