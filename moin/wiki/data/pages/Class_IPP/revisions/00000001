Same as [[Class_IP|$\text{IP}$]], except that if the answer is "yes," there need only be a prover strategy that causes the verifier to accept with probability greater than 1/2, while if the answer is "no," then for all prover strategies the verifier accepts with probability less than 1/2.}}}

Defined in [[ZooRefs#CCG+94|[CCG+94] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_IPP|$\text{IPP}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] relative to all oracles.  Since [[Class_IP|$\text{IP}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] relative to a random oracle, the authors interpreted this as evidence against the Random Oracle Hypothesis (a slight change in definition can cause the behavior of a class relative to a random oracle to change drastically).
