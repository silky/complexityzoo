= AUC-SPACE(f(n)) - Randomized Alternating f(n)-Space =

== Comments ==

The class of problems decidable by an O(f(n))-space Turing machine with three kinds of quantifiers: existential, universal, and randomized.



Contains [[Class_GAN-SPACE(f(n))|$\text{GAN-SPACE(f(n))}$]].



AUC-SPACE(poly(n)) = [[Class_SAPTIME|$\text{SAPTIME}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#Pap83|[Pap83] ]].



[[ZooRefs#Con92|[Con92] ]] shows that AUC-SPACE(log n) has a natural complete problem, and is contained in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] âˆ© [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]].
