== Comments ==

The class of problems decidable by an O(f(n))-space Turing machine with three kinds of quantifiers: existential, universal, and randomized.

Contains GAN-SPACE(f(n)).

AUC-SPACE(poly(n)) = SAPTIME = PSPACE [Pap83].

[Con92] shows that AUC-SPACE(log n) has a natural complete problem, and is contained in NP âˆ© coNP.
