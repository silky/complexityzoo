{{{#!description

The class of decision problems such that whether the answer on input x agrees with the answer on input x-1 (that is, the lexicographic predecessor of x) is solvable in polynomial time.  The Turing machine has to decide agreement or disagreement without access to the answer for x-1.}}}

Is contained in [[Class_E|$\text{E}$]], [[Class_NT*|$\text{NT*}$]], and [[Class_⊕P|$\text{⊕P}$]].  Defined in [[ZooRefs#GHJ+91|[GHJ+91] ]] to study ⊕P-complete problems.  They show  that [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], [[Class_NT|$\text{NT}$]], [[Class_NT*|$\text{NT*}$]], and [[Class_⊕P|$\text{⊕P}$]] are either all equal or strictly nested.  In particular, they differ with probability 1 relative to a random oracle.
