= GLO - Guaranteed Local Optima =

== Comments ==

The class of [[Class_NPO|$\text{NPO}$]] problems which have the property that for all locally optimal solutions, the ratio between the values of the local and global optima is upper-bounded by a constant.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#AP95|[AP95] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_GLO|$\text{GLO}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_APX|$\text{APX}$]].



[[ZooRefs#KMS+99|[KMS+99] ]] showed that [[Class_MaxSNP|$\text{MaxSNP}$]] is not contained in [[Class_GLO|$\text{GLO}$]].
