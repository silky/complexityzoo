= GLO - Guaranteed Local Optima =

== Comments ==

The class of NPO problems which have the property that for all locally optimal solutions, the ratio between the values of the local and global optima is upper-bounded by a constant.

Defined in [AP95], where it was also shown that GLO is strictly contained in APX.

[KMS+99] showed that MaxSNP is not contained in GLO.
