{{{#!description

The class of languages accepted by a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine subject to the constraint that at every time step t, the machine's state is exponentially close to a tree state -- that is, a state expressible by a polynomial-size tree of additions and tensor products (together with complex constants and |0> and |1> leaf nodes).}}}

More formally, a uniform classical polynomial-time algorithm generates a sequence of gates g^(1)^, ... ,g^(p(n))^.  Each g^(t)^ can be either be selected from some finite universal basis of unitary gates (the choice turns out not to matter), or can be a 1-qubit measurement.  When we perform a measurement, the state evolves to one of two possible pure states, with the usual probabilities, rather than to a mixed state.  We require that the final gate g^(p(n))^ is a measurement of the first qubit.  If at least one intermediate state was more than distance 2^-Î©(n)^ away from the nearest state of tree size at most p(n), then the outcome of the final measurement is chosen adversarially; otherwise it is given by the usual Born probabilities.  The measurement must return 1 with probability at least 2/3 if the input is in the language, and with probability at most 1/3 otherwise.



Contains [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]], and is contained in [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]].



Defined in [Aar03b], where it was also shown that [[Class_TreeBQP|$\text{TreeBQP}$]] is

contained in the third level of [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]], which might provide weak evidence that

[[Class_TreeBQP|$\text{TreeBQP}$]] does not equal [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]].
