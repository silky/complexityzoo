Same as [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]], except that now the computation paths need not all have the same length.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#HHT97|[HHT97] ]], where the following was also shown:



[[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] contains [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] and [[Class_PNP[log]|$\text{PNP[log]}$]], and is contained in [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] and BPP^NP^.

[[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] is closed under complementation, intersection, and union.

If [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] = BPP,,path,,^BPP,,path,,^, then [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] collapses to [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]].

If [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] contains [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]], then [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] collapses to BPP^NP^.



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] is not contained in [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]] [[ZooRefs#BGM02|[BGM02] ]].



An alternate characterization of [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] uses the idea of post-selection. That is, [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] is the class of languages  for which there exists a pair of polynomial-time Turing machines  and  such that the following conditions hold for all :



If , .

 If , .

 .



We say that  is the post-selector. Intuitively, this characterization allows a [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine to require that its random bits have some special but easily verifiable property. This characterization makes the inclusion [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] ⊆ [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPPpath}$]] nearly trivial.
