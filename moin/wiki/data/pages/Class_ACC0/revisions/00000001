== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_AC0[m]|$\text{AC0[m]}$]], but now the constant-depth circuit can contain MOD m gates for any m.



Contained in [[Class_TC0|$\text{TC0}$]].



Indeed, can be simulated by depth-3 threshold circuits of quasipolynomial size [[ZooRefs#Yao90|[Yao90] ]].



According to [[ZooRefs#All96|[All96] ]], there is no good evidence for the existence of cryptographically secure functions in [[Class_ACC0|$\text{ACC0}$]].



There is no non-uniform [[Class_ACC0|$\text{ACC0}$]] circuits of polynomial size for NTIMES[2^n^] and no [[Class_ACC0|$\text{ACC0}$]] circuit of size 2^n^O(1)^^ for E^NP^ (The class [[Class_E|$\text{E}$]] with an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] oracle). These are the only two known nontrivial lower bounds against [[Class_ACC0|$\text{ACC0}$]] and were recently discovered by [[ZooRefs#Wil11|[Wil11] ]].



Contains 4-PBP [[ZooRefs#BT88|[BT88] ]].



See also: [[Class_QACC0|$\text{QACC0}$]].



In 1996, [[ZooRefs#All96|[All96] ]] suggested the existence of cryptographically secure functions in [[Class_ACC0|$\text{ACC0}$]] as an important open question. In 2004, work of [[ZooRefs#AIK04|[AIK04] ]] showed pseudorandom generators in [[Class_NC0|$\text{NC0}$]] based on widely-believed assumptions.
