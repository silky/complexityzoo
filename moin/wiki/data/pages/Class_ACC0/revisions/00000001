= ACC^0^ - AC0 With Arbitrary MOD Gates =

== Comments ==

Same as AC^0^[m], but now the constant-depth circuit can contain MOD m gates for any m.

Contained in TC^0^.

Indeed, can be simulated by depth-3 threshold circuits of quasipolynomial size [Yao90].

According to [All96], there is no good evidence for the existence of cryptographically secure functions in ACC^0^.

There is no non-uniform ACC^0^ circuits of polynomial size for NTIMES[2^n^] and no ACC^0^ circuit of size 2^n^O(1)^^ for E^NP^ (The class E with an NP oracle). These are the only two known nontrivial lower bounds against ACC^0^ and were recently discovered by [Wil11].

Contains 4-PBP [BT88].

See also: QACC^0^.

In 1996, [All96] suggested the existence of cryptographically secure functions in ACC^0^ as an important open question. In 2004, work of [AIK04] showed pseudorandom generators in NC^0^ based on widely-believed assumptions.
