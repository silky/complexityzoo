= QRG(k) - k-turn Quantum Refereed Games =

== Comments ==

Same as QRG, except that now the verifier exchanges exactly k messages with each prover where k is a polynomial-bounded function of the input length.  Messages are exchanged in parallel.  QRG(k) is the quantum version of RG(k).  By definition, QRG(poly) = QRG.  See also QRG(1) and QRG(2).

QRG(k) trivially contains RG(k) for each k (and hence PSPACE when ).  QRG(4) trivially contains SQG.

QRG(k) is trivially contained in QRG for each k (and hence EXP).

Other than these trivial bounds, very little is known of QRG(k) for intermediate values of k.  For example, does QRG(k) = RG(k) for each k?
