== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_QRG|$\text{QRG}$]], except that now the verifier exchanges exactly k messages with each prover where k is a polynomial-bounded function of the input length.  Messages are exchanged in parallel.  QRG(k) is the quantum version of RG(k).  By definition, QRG(poly) = [[Class_QRG|$\text{QRG}$]].  See also QRG(1) and QRG(2).}}}

QRG(k) trivially contains RG(k) for each k (and hence [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] when $ k \geq 2$).  QRG(4) trivially contains [[Class_SQG|$\text{SQG}$]].



QRG(k) is trivially contained in [[Class_QRG|$\text{QRG}$]] for each k (and hence [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]]).



Other than these trivial bounds, very little is known of QRG(k) for intermediate values of k.  For example, does QRG(k) = RG(k) for each k?
