{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that}}}

If the answer is 'yes,' at least 1/2 of computation paths accept.

If the answer is 'no,' all computation paths reject.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Gil77|[Gil77] ]] (implicitly: the class VPP that is defined is equivalent to [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] by running the recognizer as many times as necessary to reach probability 1/2).



Contains the problem of testing whether an integer is prime [[ZooRefs#AH87|[AH87] ]], although this problem was subsequently shown to be in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] [[ZooRefs#AKS02|[AKS02] ]].



For other problems in [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]], see the standard text on randomized algorithms, [[ZooRefs#MR95|[MR95] ]].



Has the same p-measure as [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]]. Moreover, this measure is either zero or one. If the measure is non-zero, then [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] = [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] = [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#IM03|[IM03] ]].
