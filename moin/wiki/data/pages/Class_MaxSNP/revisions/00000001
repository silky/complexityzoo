The class of optimization problems reducible by an "L-reduction" to a problem in MaxSNP,,0,,.  (Note: 'L' stands for linear -- this is not the same as an L reduction!  For more details see [PY88].)

Defined in [PY88], where the following was also shown:

Max3SAT is MaxSNP-complete.  (Max3SAT is the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses in a CNF formula with at most 3 literals per clause.)
Any problem in MaxSNP can be approximated to within a fixed ratio.

The closure of MaxSNP under PTAS reduction is APX [KMS+99], [CT94].
