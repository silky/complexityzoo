== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of optimization problems reducible by an "L-reduction" to a problem in [[Class_MaxSNP0|$\text{MaxSNP}_\text{0}\text{}$]].  (Note: 'L' stands for linear -- this is not the same as an [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] reduction!  For more details see [[ZooRefs#PY88|[PY88] ]].)}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#PY88|[PY88] ]], where the following was also shown:



Max3SAT is MaxSNP-complete.  (Max3SAT is the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses in a CNF formula with at most 3 literals per clause.)

Any problem in [[Class_MaxSNP|$\text{MaxSNP}$]] can be approximated to within a fixed ratio.



The closure of [[Class_MaxSNP|$\text{MaxSNP}$]] under [[Class_PTAS|$\text{PTAS}$]] reduction is [[Class_APX|$\text{APX}$]] [[ZooRefs#KMS+99|[KMS+99] ]], [[ZooRefs#CT94|[CT94] ]].
