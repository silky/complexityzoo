== Description ==

{{{#!description

Identical to [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] except for that Arthur (the verifier) has random access to the proof string given by Merlin, and is limited to running times of order $O(\textrm{poly}(\log n))$.}}}

== Comments ==



This class was used by [[ZooRefs#SM03|[SM03] ]] to show that if [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] has circuits of polynomial size, then [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]].
