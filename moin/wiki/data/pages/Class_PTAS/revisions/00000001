== Description ==

{{{#!description

The subclass of [[Class_NPO|$\text{NPO}$]] problems that admit an approximation scheme in the following sense.  For any ε>0, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution whose cost is within a 1+ε factor of the optimum cost.  (However, the exponent of the polynomial might depend strongly on ε.)}}}

Contains [[Class_FPTAS|$\text{FPTAS}$]], and is contained in [[Class_APX|$\text{APX}$]].



As an example, the Traveling Salesman Problem in the Euclidean plane is in [[Class_PTAS|$\text{PTAS}$]] [[ZooRefs#Aro96|[Aro96] ]].
