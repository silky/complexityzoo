= BQP/mpoly - BQP With Polynomial-Size Deterministic Merlin-Like Advice =

== Comments ==

The class of languages recognized by a syntactic [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine with deterministic polynomial advice that depends only on the input length, such that the output is correct with probability 2/3 when the advice is good.



Can also be defined as the class of problems solvable by a nonuniform family of polynomial-size quantum circuits, just as [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] is the class solvable by a nonuniform family of polynomial-size classical circuits.



Referred to with a variety of other ad hoc names, including [[Class_BQP/poly|$\text{BQP/poly}$]] on occassion.



Contains [[Class_BQP/qlog|$\text{BQP/qlog}$]], and is contained in [[Class_BQP/qpoly|$\text{BQP/qpoly}$]].



Does not contain [[Class_ESPACE|$\text{ESPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#NY03|[NY03] ]].
