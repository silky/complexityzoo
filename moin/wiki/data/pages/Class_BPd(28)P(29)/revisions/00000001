== Comments ==

Defined in [Weg88].

The class of decision problems solvable by a family of polynomial size branching programs, with the additional condition that each bit of the input is tested at most d times.

BP,,d,,(P) strictly contains BP,,d-1,,(P), for every d > 1 [Tha98].

Contained in PBP.
