Defined in [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]] as a subclass of [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]].  There are three syntactic restrictions defining the subclass [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]], based on the form of the [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]] formula defining the language:}}}

The second order existentially quantified variables, known as the proof relations, are restricted to be monadic.  (Monadic relations can be treated as sets.)

 Any relations in the formula other than the proof relations must occur only negated (the formula is monotone).

 No inequality relations can occur in the formula.



[[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] seems to obey dichotomy, by excluding languages that are NP-intermediate.  This is still open but widely believed.  Dropping any of the restrictions monotone/monadic/without inequalities allows NP-intermediate languages unless [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]], since any problem in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is polynomial time equivalent to a problem in each of these broader classes.  [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] therefore seems to be a maximal fragment of [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] where NP-intermediate languages are excluded.



Every constraint satisfaction problem with a fixed target structure is expressible in [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]], and there is a polynomial time Turing reduction from every [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] query to finitely many constraint satisfaction problems.  [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] therefore seems to capture the class of constraint satisfaction problems with fixed templates, [[Class_CSP|$\text{CSP}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#FV93|[FV93] ]] as a subclass of [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]], where the second order existentially quantified variables are sets (monadic) and any relations in the first-order part occur negated (monotone).  Further, no inequalities can occur in the first-order part.



[[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] seems to obey dichotomy, by excluding Ladner languages.  This is still open but widely believed.  Dropping any of the restrictions monotone/monadic/without inequalities          allows Ladner languages unless [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]], since any problem in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is polynomial time equivalent to a problem in each of these broader classes.  [[Class_MMSNP|$\text{MMSNP}$]] therefore seems to be a maximal fragment of [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] where Ladner languages are excluded.
