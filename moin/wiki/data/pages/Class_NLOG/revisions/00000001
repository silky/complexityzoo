= NLOG - NL With Nondeterministic Oracle Tape =

== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]] -- but if there's an oracle, then [[Class_NLOG|$\text{NLOG}$]] can make queries nondeterministically on a polynomial-size, one-way oracle tape.  (NL, by contrast, can use nondeterministic transitions only on the worktape; oracle queries have to be deterministic.)



See [[ZooRefs#LL76|[LL76] ]] or [[ZooRefs#HCK+88|[HCK+88] ]] for more information.



Although [[Class_NLOG|$\text{NLOG}$]] is contained in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], there exists an oracle relative to which that is not the case.  This illustrates that care is needed when defining oracle access mechanisms.
