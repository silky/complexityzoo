== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]] -- but if there's an oracle, then [[Class_NLOG|$\text{NLOG}$]] can make queries nondeterministically on a polynomial-size, one-way oracle tape.  ([[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]], by contrast, can use nondeterministic transitions only on the worktape; oracle queries have to be deterministic.)}}}

Although [[Class_NLOG|$\text{NLOG}$]] is contained in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], there exists an oracle relative to which that is not the case.  This illustrates that care is needed when defining oracle access mechanisms.
