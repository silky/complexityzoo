== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of problems solvable by a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine that receives a quantum state Ïˆ,,n,, as advice, which depends only on the input length n.}}}

== Complete Problem ==

== Comments ==



As with [[Class_BQP/mpoly|$\text{BQP/mpoly}$]], the acceptance probability does not need to be bounded away from 1/2 if the machine is given bad advice. (Thus, we are discussing the class that [[ZooRefs#NY03|[NY03] ]] call BQP/*Qpoly.) Indeed, such a condition would make quantum advice unusable, by a continuity argument.



Does not contain [[Class_EESPACE|$\text{EESPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#NY03|[NY03] ]].



[Aar04b] shows the following:



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_BQP/qpoly|$\text{BQP/qpoly}$]] does not contain [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].

[[Class_BQP/qpoly|$\text{BQP/qpoly}$]] is contained in [[Class_PP/poly|$\text{PP/poly}$]].



A classical oracle separation between [[Class_BQP/qpoly|$\text{BQP/qpoly}$]] and [[Class_BQP/mpoly|$\text{BQP/mpoly}$]] is presently unknown, but there is a quantum oracle separation [[ZooRefs#AK06|[AK06] ]].  An unrelativized separation is too much to hope for, since it would imply that [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] is not contained in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]].



Contains [[Class_BQP/mpoly|$\text{BQP/mpoly}$]].
