== Description ==

{{{#!description

SO(krom) is the set of boolean queries definable with second-order formulae in normal form such that the quantifier-free part of the formula is in Krom form, wich means that in every clause there is at most two literals and the first-order portion contains no existential quantifiers.}}}

== Comments ==



It was shown in [GraÌˆ92] that this class is equal to [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].



Those formulaes can be made in prenex form where the second order is existential and the first order universal without loss of generalities.
