== Comments ==

SO(krom) is the set of boolean queries definable with second-order formulae in normal form such that the quantifier-free part of the formula is in Krom form, wich means that in every clause there is at most two literals and the first-order portion contains no existential quantifiers.

It was shown in [GraÌˆ92] that this class is equal to NL.

Those formulaes can be made in prenex form where the second order is existential and the first order universal without loss of generalities.
