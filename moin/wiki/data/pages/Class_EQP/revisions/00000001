The same as BQP, except that the quantum algorithm must return the correct answer with probability 1, and run in polynomial time with probability 1.  Unlike bounded-error quantum computing, there is no theory of universal QTMs for exact quantum computing models.  In the original definition in [BV97], each language in EQP is computed by a single QTM, equivalently to a uniform family of quantum circuits with a finite gate set K whose amplitudes can be computed in polynomial time. See EQP,,K,,.  However, some results require an infinite gate set.  The official definition here is that the gate set should be finite.

Without loss of generality, the amplitudes in the gate set K are algebraic numbers [ADH97].

There is an oracle that separates EQP from NP [BV97], indeed from Î”,,2,,P [GP01].  There is also an oracle relative to which EQP is not in Mod,,p,,P where p is prime [GV02].  On the other hand, EQP is in LWPP [FR98].

P^||NP[2k]^ is contained in EQP^||NP[k]^, where "||NP[k]" denotes k nonadaptive oracle queries to NP (queries that cannot depend on the results of previous queries) [BD99].
