The class of questions that can be answered by a QTM that accepts with probability 0 when the true answer is no, and accepts with probability at least 1/2 when the true answer is yes.  Since one of the probabilities has to vanish, RQP has the same technical caveats as EQP.

Contains ZQP and RBQP, and is contained in BQP.
