= RQP - One-sided Error Extension of EQP =

== Comments ==

The class of questions that can be answered by a QTM that accepts with probability 0 when the true answer is no, and accepts with probability at least 1/2 when the true answer is yes.  Since one of the probabilities has to vanish, [[Class_RQP|$\text{RQP}$]] has the same technical caveats as [[Class_EQP|$\text{EQP}$]].



Contains [[Class_ZQP|$\text{ZQP}$]] and [[Class_RBQP|$\text{RBQP}$]], and is contained in [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]].
