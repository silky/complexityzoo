Defined in [[ZooRefs#Bra06|[Bra06] ]]. It was shown there that Quantum k-SAT is QMA,,1,,-complete for any $ k \geq 4$. It was also shown there that Quantum 2-SAT is in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



This result was later improved in [[ZooRefs#GN13|[GN13] ]] where it was shown that Quantum 3-SAT is QMA,,1,,-complete.
