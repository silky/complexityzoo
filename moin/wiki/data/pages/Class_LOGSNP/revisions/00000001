The class of decision problems expressible in logical form as

The set of I for which there exists a subset S={s,,1,,,...,s,,log n,,} of {1,...,n} of size log n, such that for all x there exists j in S such that the predicate φ(I,s,,j,,,x,j) holds.  Here x is a logarithmic-length string, or equivalently a polynomially bounded number, and φ is computable in P.

LOGSNP,,0,, is the subclass in which φ is a first-order predicate without quantifiers and x is a bounded lists of indices of input bits.  LOGSNP is also the closure of LOGSNP,,0,, under many-one reduction.  See LOGNP and SNP for the motivation.

Defined in [PY96].

Contained in LOGNP, and therefore QPLIN.

If P = LOGSNP, then for every constructible f(n) > n, NTIME(f(n)) is contained in DTIME(g(n)^sqrt(g(n))^), where g(n) = O(f(n) logf(n)) [FK97].

The set of I for which there exists a subset S={s,,1,,,...,s,,log n,,} of {1,...,n} of size log n, such that for all x there exists j such that the predicate φ(I,s,,j,,,x,j) holds.  Here x and y are logarithmic-length strings, or equivalently polynomially bounded numbers, and φ is computable in P.
