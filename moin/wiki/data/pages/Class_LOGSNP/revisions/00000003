The set of I for which there exists a subset S={s,,1,,,...,s,,log n,,} of {1,...,n} of size log n, such that for all x there exists j in S such that the predicate φ(I,s,,j,,,x,j) holds.  Here x is a logarithmic-length string, or equivalently a polynomially bounded number, and φ is computable in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



LOGSNP,,0,, is the subclass in which φ is a first-order predicate without quantifiers and x is a bounded lists of indices of input bits.  [[Class_LOGSNP|$\text{LOGSNP}$]] is also the closure of LOGSNP,,0,, under many-one reduction.  See [[Class_LOGNP|$\text{LOGNP}$]] and [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]] for the motivation.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#PY96|[PY96] ]].



Contained in [[Class_LOGNP|$\text{LOGNP}$]], and therefore [[Class_QPLIN|$\text{QPLIN}$]].



If [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_LOGSNP|$\text{LOGSNP}$]], then for every constructible f(n) > n, NTIME(f(n)) is contained in DTIME(g(n)^sqrt(g(n))^), where g(n) = O(f(n) logf(n)) [[ZooRefs#FK97|[FK97] ]].



The set of I for which there exists a subset S={s,,1,,,...,s,,log n,,} of {1,...,n} of size log n, such that for all x there exists j such that the predicate φ(I,s,,j,,,x,j) holds.  Here x and y are logarithmic-length strings, or equivalently polynomially bounded numbers, and φ is computable in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].
