== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable in time O(t(n)) by a nondeterministic Turing machine, as follows.  The machine is given oracle access to a proof string of unbounded length.

If the answer is "yes," then there exists a value of the proof string such that all computation paths accept.
If the answer is "no," then for all values of the proof string, there exists a computation path that rejects.

An interesting question is whether NP = PFCHK(log n) relative to all possible oracles.  Fortnow [For94] observes that the answer depends on what oracle access mechanism is used.
