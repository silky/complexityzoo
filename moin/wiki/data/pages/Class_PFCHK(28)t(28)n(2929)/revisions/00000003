== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable in time O(t(n)) by a nondeterministic Turing machine, as follows.  The machine is given oracle access to a proof string of unbounded length.}}}

== Complete Problem ==

{{{#!complete_problem

}}}

== Comments ==



If the answer is "yes," then there exists a value of the proof string such that all computation paths accept.

If the answer is "no," then for all values of the proof string, there exists a computation path that rejects.



Credited in [[ZooRefs#For94|[For94] ]] to S. Arora, [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]]. Impagliazzo, and U. Vazirani.



An interesting question is whether [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] = PFCHK(log n) relative to all possible oracles.  Fortnow [[ZooRefs#For94|[For94] ]] observes that the answer depends on what oracle access mechanism is used.
