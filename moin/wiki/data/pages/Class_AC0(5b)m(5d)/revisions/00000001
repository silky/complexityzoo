= AC^0^[m] - AC0 With MOD m Gates =

Same as [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC0}$]], but now "MOD m" gates (for a specific m) are allowed in addition to AND, OR, and NOT gates.  (A MOD m gate outputs 0 if the sum of its inputs is congruent to 0 modulo m, and 1 otherwise.)



If m is a power of a prime p, then for any prime q not equal to p, deciding whether the sum of n bits is congruent to 0 modulo q is not in [[Class_AC0[m]|$\text{AC0[m]}$]] [[ZooRefs#Raz87|[Raz87] ]] [[ZooRefs#Smo87|[Smo87] ]].  It follows that, for any such m, [[Class_AC0[m]|$\text{AC0[m]}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_NC1|$\text{NC1}$]].



However, if m is a product of distinct primes (e.g. 6), then it is not even known whether [[Class_AC0[m]|$\text{AC0[m]}$]] = NP!
