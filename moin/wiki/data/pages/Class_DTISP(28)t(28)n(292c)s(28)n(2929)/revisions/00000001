== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine that uses time O(t(n)) and space O(s(n)) simultaneously.

Thus SC = DTISP(poly,polylog) for example.

Defined in [Nis92], where it was also shown that for all space-constructible s(n)=Î©(log n), BPSPACE(s(n)) is contained in DTISP(2^O(s(n))^,s^2^(n)).
