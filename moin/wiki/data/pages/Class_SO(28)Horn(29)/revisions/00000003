== Description ==

{{{#!description

SO(horn) is the set of boolean queries definable with second-order formulae in normal form such that the quantifier-free part of the formula is in conjunctive normal form with at most one positive instance of a quantified relation per clause.  (Atomic queries to the database don't count.)}}}

== Comments ==



It was shown in [GraÌˆ92] that this class is equal to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



Those formulae can be made in prenex form where the second order is existential and the first order universal without loss of generality.
