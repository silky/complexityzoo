There are several variants (which we only describe roughly), including:



SKC,,hint,,(k(n)): Hint sense.  The simulator can reproduce Arthur's view of the protocol if given a hint string of size k(n).

SKC,,hint,,(k(n)): Strict oracle sense.  The simulator can reproduce Arthur's view if allowed k(n) queries to an oracle O.

SKC,,avg,,(k(n)): Average oracle sense.  For each input, the expected number of queries the simulator makes to oracle O is at most k(n).

SKC,,ent,,(k(n)): Entropy sense.  Defined in [[ZooRefs#ABV95|[ABV95] ]]. For each input, the expectation (over Arthur's random coins) of -log(P) is at most k(n), where [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] is the probability that the view output by the simulator equals the view resulting from the actual protocol.
