= MIP* - MIP With Quantum Provers =

== Comments ==

Same as MIP, except that the provers can share arbitrarily many entangled qubits.  The verifier is classical, as are all messages between the provers and verifier.

Defined in [CHT+04], where evidence was given suggesting that MIP* does not "obviously" equal NEXP.

MIP* contains NEXP [IV12]. By contrast, MIP, the corresponding class without entanglement, equals NEXP (and even MIP[2,1] with two provers and one round equals NEXP).

Even MIP*[4,poly] and MIP[5,1] contain NEXP [IV12].

MIP*[2,1] contains XOR-MIP*[2,1].

In 2012 it was shown that QMIP = MIP* [RUV12]
