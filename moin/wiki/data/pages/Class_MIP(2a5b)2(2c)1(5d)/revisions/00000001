= MIP*[2,1] - 2-Prover, 1-Round MIP With Quantum Provers =

----
CategoryQuantum 

== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as MIP[2], except that now only one round is allowed, and the two provers can share arbitrarily many entangled qubits.  The verifier is classical, as are all messages between the provers and verifier.}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#CHT+04|[CHT+04] ]], where evidence was given suggesting that [[Class_MIP*|$\text{MIP*}$]] does not "obviously" equal [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]].  By contrast, MIP[2,1], the corresponding class without entanglement, equals [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]].



Indeed, the relationship between [[Class_MIP*|$\text{MIP*}$]] and [[Class_MIP|$\text{MIP}$]] = [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] is completely unknown -- either could contain the other, or they could be incomparable.



It is also unknown whether increasing the number of provers or rounds changes [[Class_MIP*[2,1]|$\text{MIP*[2,1]}$]].



Contains [[Class_XOR-MIP*[2,1]|$\text{XOR-MIP*[2,1]}$]].
