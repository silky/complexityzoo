= F-TAPE(f(n)) - Provable DSPACE(f(n)) For Formal System F =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems that can be proven to be solvable in O(f(n)) space on a deterministic Turing machine, from the axioms of formal system F.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Har78|[Har78] ]].



See also [[Class_F-TIME(f(n))|$\text{F-TIME(f(n))}$]].  The results about F-TAPE mirror those about F-TIME, but in some cases are sharper.
