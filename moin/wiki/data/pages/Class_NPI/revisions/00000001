== Description ==

{{{#!description

Sometimes used to denote the set of decision problems in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] that are neither NP-complete (that is, in [[Class_NPC|$\text{NPC}$]]) nor in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].}}}

== Complete Problem ==

{{{#!complete_problem

}}}

== Comments ==



Is thought to contain (for example) decision versions of factoring and graph isomorphism.



Is nonempty if [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Lad75|[Lad75] ]].  Indeed, under this assumption, it contains an infinite number of distinct polynomial-time equivalence classes.
