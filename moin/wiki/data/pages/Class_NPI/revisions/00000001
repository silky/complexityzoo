Sometimes used to denote the set of decision problems in NP that are neither NP-complete (that is, in NPC) nor in P.

Is thought to contain (for example) decision versions of factoring and graph isomorphism.

Is nonempty if P does not equal NP [Lad75].  Indeed, under this assumption, it contains an infinite number of distinct polynomial-time equivalence classes.
