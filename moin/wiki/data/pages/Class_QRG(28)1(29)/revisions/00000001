The class of problems for which there exists a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine M such that:



If the answer is "yes," then there exists a quantum state ρ such that for all quantum states σ, M(ρ,σ) accepts with probability at least 2/3.

If the answer is "no," then there exists a σ such that for all ρ, M(ρ,σ) rejects with probability at least 2/3.



In other words, it's the same as [[Class_QRG(k)|$\text{QRG(k)}$]] for , the class of problems that admit quantum interactive proofs with competing provers in which there's no communication from the verifier back to the provers.  [[Class_QRG(1)|$\text{QRG(1)}$]] is the quantum version of [[Class_RG(1)|$\text{RG(1)}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#JW09|[JW09] ]], where it was shown that [[Class_QRG(1)|$\text{QRG(1)}$]] is contained in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] .



[[Class_QRG(1)|$\text{QRG(1)}$]] trivially contains [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] (and indeed P^QMA^).



[[Class_QRG(1)|$\text{QRG(1)}$]] is trivially contained in [[Class_QRG(2)|$\text{QRG(2)}$]] (and hence PSPACE).
