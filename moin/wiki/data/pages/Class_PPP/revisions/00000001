The subclass of [[Class_TFNP|$\text{TFNP}$]] function problems that are guaranteed to have a solution because of the Pigeonhole Principle.



More precisely, we're given a Boolean circuit, that maps n-bit strings to n-bit strings.  The problem is to return either an input that maps to 0^n^, or two inputs that map to the same output.



Contained in [[Class_TFNP|$\text{TFNP}$]].



Contains [[Class_PPADS|$\text{PPADS}$]].



[[ZooRefs#BCE+95|[BCE+95] ]] give oracles relative to which [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] is not contained in [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]] and [[Class_PPAD|$\text{PPAD}$]], and [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]] is not contained in [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]].



[[ZooRefs#Mor01|[Mor01] ]] gives an oracle relative to which [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] is not contained in [[Class_PLS|$\text{PLS}$]].



Whether [[Class_PLS|$\text{PLS}$]] is not contained in [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] relative to some oracle remains open.



A level of the counting hierarchy [[Class_CH|$\text{CH}$]].



It is not known whether there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] does not equal [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]].



Contains PP^PH^ [[ZooRefs#Tod89|[Tod89] ]].



Equals [[Class_PSharpP|$\text{P#P}$]] (exercise for the visitor).



Since the permanent of a matrix is #P-complete [[ZooRefs#Val79|[Val79] ]], Toda's theorem implies that any problem in the polynomial hierarchy can be solved by computing a sequence of permanents.
