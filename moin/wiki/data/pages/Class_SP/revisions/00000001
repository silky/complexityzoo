= SP - Semi-Efficient Parallel =

== Comments ==

The class of problems in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] for which the best parallel algorithm (using a polynomial number of processors) is faster than the best serial algorithm by a factor of Ω(n^ε^) for some ε>0.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KRS90|[KRS90] ]].



[[Class_SP|$\text{SP}$]] is also an alternate name for [[Class_XPuniform|$\text{XPuniform}$]]
