= MA' - Sparse MA =

== Comments ==

The subclass of [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] such that for each input size n, there is a sparse set S,,n,, that Merlin's proof string always belongs to (no matter what the input is).



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KST93|[KST93] ]], where it is also observed that if graph isomorphism is in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]], then the complement of graph isomorphism is in [[Class_MA'|$\text{MA'}$]].
