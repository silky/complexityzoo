A generalization of W[1].

The class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are fixed-parameter reducible to the following problem, for some constant h:

Weighted Weft-t Depth-h Circuit-SAT: Given a Boolean circuit C, with a mixture of fanin-2 and unbounded-fanin gates.  The number unbounded-fanin gates along any path to the root is at most t, and the total depth (fanin-2 and unbounded-fanin) is at most h.  Does C have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight k?

See W[1] for the definition of fixed-parameter reducibility.

Defined in [DF99].

Contained in W[SAT] and in W^*^[t].
