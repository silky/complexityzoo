The class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are fixed-parameter reducible to the following problem, for some constant h:



Weighted Weft-t Depth-h Circuit-SAT: Given a Boolean circuit C, with a mixture of fanin-2 and unbounded-fanin gates.  The number unbounded-fanin gates along any path to the root is at most t, and the total depth (fanin-2 and unbounded-fanin) is at most h.  Does C have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight k?
