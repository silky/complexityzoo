See AvgP for basic notions of average-case complexity.

(NP,P-samplable) is the same as DistNP, except that the distribution μ only needs to be samplable in polynomial time.  μ's cumulative density function does not need to be computable in polynomial time.

Any problem complete for DistNP is also complete for (NP,P-samplable) [IL90].
