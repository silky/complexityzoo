See [[Class_AvgP|$\text{AvgP}$]] for basic notions of average-case complexity.



[[Class_(NP,P-samplable)|$\text{(NP,P-samplable)}$]] is the same as [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]], except that the distribution μ only needs to be samplable in polynomial time.  μ's cumulative density function does not need to be computable in polynomial time.



Any problem complete for [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] is also complete for [[Class_(NP,P-samplable)|$\text{(NP,P-samplable)}$]] [[ZooRefs#IL90|[IL90] ]].
