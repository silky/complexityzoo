See [[Class_AvgP|$\text{AvgP}$]] for basic notions of average-case complexity.}}}

== Comments ==



(NP,P-samplable) is the same as [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]], except that the distribution μ only needs to be samplable in polynomial time.  μ's cumulative density function does not need to be computable in polynomial time.



Any problem complete for [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] is also complete for (NP,P-samplable) [[ZooRefs#IL90|[IL90] ]].
