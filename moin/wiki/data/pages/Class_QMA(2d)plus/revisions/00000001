= QMA-plus - QMA With Super-Verifier =

== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]], except now the verifier can directly obtain the probability that a given observable of the certificate state, if measured, would equal 1.  (In the usual model, by contrast, one can only sample an observable.)



Defined in [[ZooRefs#AR03|[AR03] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_QMA-plus|$\text{QMA-plus}$]] = [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].
