The class of problems for which the task is to output a quantum certificate for a [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] problem, when such a certificate exists.  Thus, the desired output is a quantum state.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#JWB03|[JWB03] ]], where it is also shown that state preparation for 3-local Hamiltonians is FQMA-complete.  The authors also observe that, in contrast to the case of [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]] versus [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]], there is no obvious reduction of [[Class_FQMA|$\text{FQMA}$]] problems to [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] problems.
