{{{#!description

The class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic multitape Turing machine in linear time. Defined in [[ZooRefs#BG69|[BG69] ]], where it was shown that [[Class_Q|$\text{Q}$]] equals the class of problems solvable by a nondeterministic multitape Turing machine in exactly n steps (as opposed to O(n) steps).}}}
