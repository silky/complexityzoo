The class of problems A in NP such that Σ,,k,,P^A^ = Σ,,k+1,,P; that is, adding A as an oracle increases the power of the k^th^ level of the polynomial hierarchy by a maximum amount.

For all k, H,,k,, is contained in H,,k+1,,.

H,,0,, consists exactly of the problems complete for NP under Cook reductions.

H,,1,, consists exactly of the problems complete for NP under strong non-deterministic Turing reductions [Sch83].

Defined in [Sch83].
