{{{#!description

The class of problems A in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] such that Σ,,k,,P^A^ = Σ,,k+1,,P; that is, adding A as an oracle increases the power of the k^th^ level of the polynomial hierarchy by a maximum amount.}}}

For all k, H,,k,, is contained in H,,k+1,,.



H,,0,, consists exactly of the problems complete for [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] under Cook reductions.



H,,1,, consists exactly of the problems complete for [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] under strong non-deterministic Turing reductions [[ZooRefs#Sch83|[Sch83] ]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Sch83|[Sch83] ]].
