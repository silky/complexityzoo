If NP = coNP, then any inconsistent Boolean formula of size n has a proof of inconsistency of size polynomial in n.

If NP does not equal coNP, then P does not equal NP.  But the other direction is not known.

Every problem in coNP has an IP (interactive proof) system, where moreover the prover can be restricted to BPP^#P^. If every problem in coNP has an interactive protocol whose rounds are bounded by a polylogarithmic function, then EH collapses to the third level [SS04].

Co-NP is equal to SO-A, the second-order queries where the second-order quantifiers are only universals.
