If [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] = [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]], then any inconsistent Boolean formula of size n has a proof of inconsistency of size polynomial in n.



If [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] does not equal [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]], then [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].  But the other direction is not known.

Every problem in [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]] has an [[Class_IP|$\text{IP}$]] (interactive proof) system, where moreover the prover can be restricted to BPP^#P^. If every problem in [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]] has an interactive protocol whose rounds are bounded by a polylogarithmic function, then [[Class_EH|$\text{EH}$]] collapses to the third level [[ZooRefs#SS04|[SS04] ]].



Co-NP is equal to SO-A, the second-order queries where the second-order quantifiers are only universals.
