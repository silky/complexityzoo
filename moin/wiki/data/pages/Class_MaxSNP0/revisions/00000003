== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of function problems expressible as "find a relation such that the set of k-tuples for which a given [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]] predicate holds has maximum cardinality."}}}

== Complete Problem ==

{{{#!complete_problem

}}}

== Comments ==



For example (see [[ZooRefs#Pap94|[Pap94] ]]), the Max-Cut problem can be expressed as follows:



Given a graph G, find a subset S of vertices that maximizes the number of pairs (u,v) of vertices such that u is in S, and v is not in S, and G has an edge from u to v.
