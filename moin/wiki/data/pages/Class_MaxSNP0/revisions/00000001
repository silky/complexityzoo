The class of function problems expressible as "find a relation such that the set of k-tuples for which a given SNP predicate holds has maximum cardinality."

For example (see [Pap94]), the Max-Cut problem can be expressed as follows:

Given a graph G, find a subset S of vertices that maximizes the number of pairs (u,v) of vertices such that u is in S, and v is not in S, and G has an edge from u to v.
