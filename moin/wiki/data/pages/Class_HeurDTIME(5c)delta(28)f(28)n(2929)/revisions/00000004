{{{#!description

For functions $f(n)$ and $\delta(n)$, we say that tuple $(L,D)\in\mathsf{HeurDTIME}_{\delta}(f(n))$, where $L$ is a language and $D$ is a distribution of problem instances, if there exists a heuristic deterministic algorithm $A$ such that for all $x$ in the support of $D$, $A$ runs in time bounded by $f(n)$ and with failure probability bounded by $\delta(n)$ [[ZooRefs#BT06|[BT06] ]].}}}
