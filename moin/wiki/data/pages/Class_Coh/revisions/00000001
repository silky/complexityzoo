The class of problems L that are efficiently autoreducible, in the sense that given an input x and access to an oracle for L, a BPP machine can compute L(x) by querying L only on points that differ from x.

Defined in [Yao90b].

[BG94] show that, assuming NEE is not contained in BPEE, Coh âˆ© NP is not contained in any of compNP, Check, or frIP.
