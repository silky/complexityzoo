= NSPACE(f(n)) - Nondeterministic f(n)-Space =

== Comments ==

Same as NPSPACE, but with f(n)-space (for some constructible function f) rather than polynomial-space machines.

Contained in DSPACE(f(n)^2^) [Sav70], and indeed RevSPACE(f(n)^2^) 95|[CP95].

NSPACE(n^k^) is strictly contained in NSPACE(n^k+ε^) for ε>0 [Iba72] (actually the hierarchy theorem is stronger than this, but pretty technical to state).

Contained in DSPACE(f(n)^2^) [Sav70], and indeed RevSPACE(f(n)^2^) [CP95].
