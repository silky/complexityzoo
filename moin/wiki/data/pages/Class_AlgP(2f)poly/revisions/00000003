{{{#!description

The class of multivariate polynomials over the integers that can be evaluated using a polynomial (in the input size n) number of additions, subtractions, and multiplications, together with the constants -1 and 1.  The class is nonuniform, in the sense that the polynomial for each input size n can be completely different.}}}

Named in [[ZooRefs#Imp02|[Imp02] ]], though it has been considered since the 1970's.



If [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] (or even [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] is contained in [[Class_NE|$\text{NE}$]]), then either [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] is not in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]], or else the permanent polynomial of a matrix is not in [[Class_AlgP/poly|$\text{AlgP/poly}$]] [[ZooRefs#KI02|[KI02] ]].
