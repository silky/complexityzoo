== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

If the answer is 'yes' then at least 2/3 of the computation paths accept.
If the answer is 'no' then at most 1/3 of the computation paths accept.

(Here all computation paths have the same length.)

Often identified as the class of feasible problems for a computer with access to a genuine random-number source.

Defined in [Gil77].

Contained in Σ,,2,,P ∩ Π,,2,,P [Lau83], and indeed in ZPP^NP^ [GZ97].

If BPP contains NP, then RP = NP [Ko82,Gil77] and PH is contained in BPP [Zac88].

If any problem in E requires circuits of size 2^Ω(n)^, then BPP = P [IW97] (in other words, BPP can be derandomized).

Indeed, any proof that BPP = P requires showing either that NEXP is not in P/poly, or else that #P requires superpolynomial-size arithmetic circuits [KI02].

BPP is not known to contain complete problems.  [Sip82], [HH86] give oracles relative to which BPP has no complete problems.

There exist oracles relative to which P = RP but still P is not equal to BPP [BF99].

In contrast to the case of P, it is unknown whether BPP collapses to BPTIME(n^c^) for some fixed constant c.  However, [Bar02] and [FS04] have shown hierarchy theorems for BPP with a small amount of advice.

A zero-one law exists stating that BPP has p-measure zero unless BPP = EXP [Mel00].

Equals Almost-P.

If BPP contains NP, then RP = NP [Ko82] and PH is contained in BPP [Zac88].
