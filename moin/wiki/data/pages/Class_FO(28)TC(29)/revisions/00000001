== Comments ==

[[Class_FO(TC)|$\text{FO(TC)}$]] is the set of boolean queries definable with first-order formulae with a transitive closure (TC) operator.



TC is defined this way: let  be a positiver integer and  be vectors of  variables, then TC( is true if there exist  variables  such that  and for all  . Here,  is a formula over  written in [[Class_FO(TC)|$\text{FO(TC)}$]] and  means that the variables  and  are replaced by  and .



Every formula of TC can be written in a normal form FO( where  is a [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]] formula and we suppose that there is an order on the model where variables are quantified, so we can choose the minimum and maximum element.



It was shown in [[ZooRefs#Imm98|[Imm98] ]] page 150 that this class is equal to [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].
