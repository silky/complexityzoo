TC is defined this way: let $k$ be a positiver integer and $u,v,x,y$ be vectors of $k$ variables, then TC($\phi_{u,v})(x,y)$ is true if there exist $n$ variables $(x_i)$ such that $x_1=x, x_n=y$ and for all $i<n$ $\phi_{u,v}(x_i,x_{i+1})$. Here, $\phi_{u,v}$ is a formula over $u,v$ written in FO(TC) and $\phi_{u,v}(x,y)$ means that the variables $u$ and $v$ are replaced by $x$ and $y$.



Every formula of TC can be written in a normal form FO($\phi_{u,v})(0,max)$ where $\phi$ is a [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]] formula and we suppose that there is an order on the model where variables are quantified, so we can choose the minimum and maximum element.



It was shown in [[ZooRefs#Imm98|[Imm98] ]] page 150 that this class is equal to [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].
