FO(TC) is the set of boolean queries definable with first-order formulae with a transitive closure (TC) operator.

TC is defined this way: let  be a positiver integer and  be vectors of  variables, then TC( is true if there exist  variables  such that  and for all  . Here,  is a formula over  written in FO(TC) and  means that the variables  and  are replaced by  and .

Every formula of TC can be written in a normal form FO( where  is a FO formula and we suppose that there is an order on the model where variables are quantified, so we can choose the minimum and maximum element.

It was shown in [Imm98] page 150 that this class is equal to NL.
