= QH - Query Hierarchy Over NP =

== Comments ==

QH,,k,, is defined to be P^NP[k]^; that is, P with k queries to an NP oracle (where k is a constant).  Then QH is the union of QH,,k,, over all nonnegative k.

QH = BH [Wag88]; thus, either both hierarchies are infinite or both collapse to some finite level.

QH,,i,, is defined to be P^NP[k]^; that is, P with k queries to an NP oracle (where k is a constant).  Then QH is the union of QH,,i,, over all nonnegative i.
