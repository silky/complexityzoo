The analogue of P^cc^ for bounded-error probabilistic communication complexity.

Does not equal P^cc^, and is not contained in NP^cc^, because of the EQUALITY problem.

Defined in [BFS86].

Has the same relation to BPP^cc^ and BPP as P,,,,^cc^ does to P^cc^ and P.

NP,,,,^cc^ is not contained in BPP,,,,^cc^ for  players, for any constant  [DP08].
