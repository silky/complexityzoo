Defined as RP âˆ© coRP.

Defined as the class of problems solvable by randomized algorithms that always return the correct answer, and whose expected running time (on any input) is polynomial, in [Gil77].  (Proposition 5.5(iii) in this paper shows that the two definitions above are equivalent.)

Contains the problem of testing whether an integer is prime [SS77] [AH87].

In contrast to BPP and RP, it is not known whether showing ZPP = P requires proving superpolynomial circuit lower bounds [KI02].

There exists an oracle relative to which ZPP = EXP [Hel84a], [Hel84b], [Kur85], [Hel86].

Has the same p-measure as RP. Moreover, this measure is either zero or one. If the measure is non-zero, then ZPP = BPP = EXP [IM03].
