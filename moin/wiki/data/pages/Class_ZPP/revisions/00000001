Defined as [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] âˆ© [[Class_coRP|$\text{coRP}$]].



Defined as the class of problems solvable by randomized algorithms that always return the correct answer, and whose expected running time (on any input) is polynomial, in [[ZooRefs#Gil77|[Gil77] ]].  (Proposition 5.5(iii) in this paper shows that the two definitions above are equivalent.)



Contains the problem of testing whether an integer is prime [[ZooRefs#SS77|[SS77] ]] [[ZooRefs#AH87|[AH87] ]].



In contrast to [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] and [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]], it is not known whether showing [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] = [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] requires proving superpolynomial circuit lower bounds [[ZooRefs#KI02|[KI02] ]].



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] = [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] [Hel84a], [Hel84b], [[ZooRefs#Kur85|[Kur85] ]], [[ZooRefs#Hel86|[Hel86] ]].



Has the same p-measure as [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]]. Moreover, this measure is either zero or one. If the measure is non-zero, then [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] = [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] = [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#IM03|[IM03] ]].
