The subclass of [[Class_TFNP|$\text{TFNP}$]] function problems that are guaranteed to have a solution because of the lemma that "all graphs of maximum degree 2

have an even number of leaves."



More precisely, there's a polynomial-time algorithm that, given any string, computes its 'neighbor' strings (of which there are at most two). Then given a leaf string (i.e. one with only one neighbor), the problem is to output another leaf string.



As an example, suppose you're given a cubic graph (one where every vertex has degree 3), and a Hamiltonian cycle H on that graph.  Then by making a sequence of modifications to H (albeit possibly exponentially many), it is always possible to find a second Hamilton cycle (see [[ZooRefs#Pap94|[Pap94] ]]).  So this problem is in [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]].



Another problem in [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]] is finding an Arrow-Debreu equilibrium, given the goods and utility functions of traders in a marketplace.

There exist oracles relative to which [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]] does not contain [[Class_PLS|$\text{PLS}$]] [[ZooRefs#BM04|[BM04] ]] and [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#BCE+95|[BCE+95] ]].  There also exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_PPA|$\text{PPA}$]] is not contained in [[Class_PPP|$\text{PPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#BCE+95|[BCE+95] ]].
