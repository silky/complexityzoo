= TC^0^ - Constant-Depth Threshold Circuits =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits with unbounded fanin, which can use AND, OR, and NOT gates (as in AC^0^) as well as threshold gates.  A threshold gate returns 1 if at least half of its inputs are 1, and 0 otherwise.

A uniformity requirement is sometimes also placed.

TC^0^ contains ACC^0^, and is contained in NC^1^.

TC^0^ circuits of depth 3 are strictly more powerful than TC^0^ circuits of depth 2 [HMP+93].

TC^0^ circuits of depth 3 and quasipolynomial size can simulate all of ACC^0^ [Yao90].

There is a function in AC^0^ (explicitly given in [She08]), whose computation with TC^0^  circuits of depth 2 requires an exponential number of gates.

[NR97] give a candidate pseudorandom function family computable in TC^0^, that is secure assuming a subexponential lower bound on the hardness of factoring.  (See also [NRR01] for an improvement of this construction, as well as [Kha93].)

One implication is that, assuming such a bound, there is no natural proof in the sense of [RR97] separating TC^0^ from P/poly.  (It is important for this that a function family, and not just a candidate pseudorandom generator, is computable in TC^0^.)  Another implication is that functions in TC^0^ are likely to be difficult to learn.

The permanent of a 0-1 matrix cannot be computed in uniform TC^0^ [All99].

In a breakthrough result [Hes01] (building on [BCH86] and [CDL01]), integer division was shown to be in U,,D,,-uniform TC^0^.  Indeed division is complete for this class under AC^0^ reductions.

In a breakthrough result [Hes01] (building on [BCH86] and [CDL01]), integer division was shown to be in L-uniform TC^0^.  Indeed division is complete for this class under AC^0^ reductions.
