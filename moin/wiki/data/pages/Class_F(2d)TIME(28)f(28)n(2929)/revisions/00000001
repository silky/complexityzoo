== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems that can be proven to be solvable in O(f(n)) time on a deterministic Turing machine, from the axioms of formal system F.}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Har78|[Har78] ]], where the following was also shown:



If F-TIME(f(n)) = DTIME(f(n)), then DTIME(f(n)) is strictly contained in DTIME(f(n)g(n)) for any nondecreasing, unbounded, recursive g(n).

There exist recursive, monotonically increasing f(n) such that F-TIME(f(n)) is strictly contained in DTIME(f(n)).
