= PT,,1,, - Polynomial Threshold Functions =

== Comments ==

The class of Boolean functions f:{-1,1}^n^->{-1,1} such that f(x)=sgn(p(x)), where p is a polynomial having a number of terms polynomial in n.

Defined in [BS90], where it was also shown that PT,,1,, contains PL,,1,, (and this inclusion is strict), and that PT,,1,, is contained in PL,,âˆž,, (and this inclusion is strict).
