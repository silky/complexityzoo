The class of decision problems solvable by a family of monotone log-width polynomial-size leveled circuits.  (A leveled circuit is one where gates on each level can depend only on the level immediately below it.)

Defined in [GS90], who raise as an open problem to define a uniform version of mL.

Strictly contains mNC^1^ [GS91].

Contained in (nonuniform versions of) mNL and mcoNL.
