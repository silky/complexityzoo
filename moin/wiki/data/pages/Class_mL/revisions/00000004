== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a family of monotone log-width polynomial-size leveled circuits.  (A leveled circuit is one where gates on each level can depend only on the level immediately below it.)}}}

== Complete Problem ==

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#GS90|[GS90] ]], who raise as an open problem to define a uniform version of [[Class_mL|$\text{mL}$]].



Strictly contains [[Class_mNC1|$\text{mNC}^\text{1}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#GS91|[GS91] ]].



Contained in (nonuniform versions of) [[Class_mNL|$\text{mNL}$]] and [[Class_mcoNL|$\text{mcoNL}$]].
