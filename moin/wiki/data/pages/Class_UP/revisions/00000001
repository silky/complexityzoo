The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

If the answer is 'yes,' exactly one computation path accepts.
If the answer is 'no,' all computation paths reject.

Defined by [Val76].

"Worst-case" one-way functions exist if and only if P does not equal UP ([GS88] and independently [Ko85]).  "Worst-case" one-way permutations exist if and only if P does not equal UP âˆ© coUP [HT03].  Note that these are weaker than the one-way functions and permutations that are needed for cryptographic applications.

There exists an oracle relative to which P is strictly contained in UP is strictly contained in NP [Rac82]; indeed, these classes are distinct with probability 1 relative to a random oracle [Bei89].

NP is contained in RP^PromiseUP^ [VV86].  On the other hand, [BBF98] give an oracle relative to which P = UP but still P does not equal NP.

UP is not known or believed to contain complete problems.  [Sip82], [HH86] give oracles relative to which UP has no complete problems.

NP is contained in RP^Promise-UP^ [VV86].  On the other hand, [BBF98] give an oracle relative to which P = UP but still P does not equal NP.
