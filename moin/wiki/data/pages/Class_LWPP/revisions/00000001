The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that



If the answer is "no," then the number of accepting computation paths exactly equals the number of rejecting paths.

If the answer is "yes," then the difference of these numbers equals a function f(|x|) computable in polynomial time (i.e. FP).  Here |x| is the length of the input x, and ``polynomial time means polynomial in |x|, the length of x, rather than the length of |x|.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#FFK94|[FFK94] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]] is low for [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] and [[Class_C=P|$\text{C=P}$]].  (I.e. adding [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]] as an oracle does not increase the power of these classes.)



Contained in [[Class_WPP|$\text{WPP}$]] and [[Class_AWPP|$\text{AWPP}$]].



Contains [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]].



Also, contains the graph isomorphism problem [[ZooRefs#KST92|[KST92] ]].



Contains a whole litter of problems for solvable black-box groups: group intersection, group factorization, coset intersection, and double-coset membership [[ZooRefs#Vin04|[Vin04] ]].
