If the answer is "no," then the number of accepting computation paths exactly equals the number of rejecting paths.

If the answer is "yes," then the difference of these numbers equals a function f(|x|) computable in polynomial time (i.e. [[Class_FP|$\text{FP}$]]).  Here |x| is the length of the input x, and ``polynomial time means polynomial in |x|, the length of x, rather than the length of |x|.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#FFK94|[FFK94] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]] is low for [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] and [[Class_C=P|$\text{C}_\text{=}\text{P}$]].  (I.e. adding [[Class_LWPP|$\text{LWPP}$]] as an oracle does not increase the power of these classes.)



Contained in [[Class_WPP|$\text{WPP}$]] and [[Class_AWPP|$\text{AWPP}$]].



Contains [[Class_SPP|$\text{SPP}$]].



Also, contains the graph isomorphism problem [[ZooRefs#KST92|[KST92] ]].



Contains a whole litter of problems for solvable black-box groups: group intersection, group factorization, coset intersection, and double-coset membership [[ZooRefs#Vin04|[Vin04] ]].
