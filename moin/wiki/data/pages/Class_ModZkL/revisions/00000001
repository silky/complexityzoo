The class of decision problems solvable by a nondeterministic logspace Turing machine, such that

If the answer is "yes," then the number of accepting paths is not congruent to 0 mod k.
If the answer is "no," then there are no accepting paths.

Defined in [BDH+92], where it was also shown that ModZ,,k,,L contains LogFewNL for all k>1.

Contained in Mod,,k,,L and in NL.
