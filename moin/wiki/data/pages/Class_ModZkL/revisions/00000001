If the answer is "yes," then the number of accepting paths is not congruent to 0 mod k.

If the answer is "no," then there are no accepting paths.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BDH+92|[BDH+92] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_ModZkL|$\text{ModZ}_\text{k}\text{L}$]] contains [[Class_LogFewNL|$\text{LogFewNL}$]] for all k>1.



Contained in [[Class_ModkL|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{L}$]] and in [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].
