Computing the Parity or Majority of n bits is not in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#FSS84|[FSS84] ]].



There are functions in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] that are pseudorandom for all statistical tests in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#NW94|[NW94] ]].  But there are no functions in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] that are pseudorandom for all statistical tests in [[Class_QP|$\text{QP}$]] (quasipolynomial time) [[ZooRefs#LMN93|[LMN93] ]].



[[ZooRefs#LMN93|[LMN93] ]] showed furthermore that functions with [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] circuits of depth d are learnable in [[Class_QP|$\text{QP}$]], given their outputs on O(2^log(n)^O(d)^) randomly chosen inputs.  On the other hand, this learning algorithm is essentially optimal, unless there is a 2^n^o(1)^ algorithm for factoring [[ZooRefs#Kha93|[Kha93] ]].



Although there are no good pseudorandom functions in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], [[ZooRefs#IN96|[IN96] ]] showed that there are pseudorandom generators that stretch n bits to n+Θ(log n), assuming the hardness of a problem based on subset sum.



[[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] contains [[Class_NC0|$\text{NC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], and is contained in [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QAC}_\text{f}\text{}^\text{0}\text{}$]] and [[Class_MAC0|$\text{MAC}^\text{0}\text{}$]].



In descriptive complexity, uniform [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] can be characterized as the class of problems expressible by first-order predicates with addition and multiplication operators - or indeed, with ordering and multiplication, or ordering and division (see [[ZooRefs#Lee02|[Lee02] ]]). So it's equivalent to the class [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]] and to [[Class_AL|$\text{AL}$]] the alternating logtime hierarchy.



[[ZooRefs#BLM+98|[BLM+98] ]] showed the following problem is complete for depth-k [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] circuits (with a uniformity condition):



Given a grid graph of polynomial length and width k, decide whether there is a path between vertices s and t (which can be given as part of the input).



Computing the parity or majority of n bits is not in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#FSS84|[FSS84] ]].



Although there are no good pseudorandom functions in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], [[ZooRefs#IN96|[IN96] ]] showed that there are pseudorandom generators in [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] that stretch n bits to n+Θ(log n), assuming the hardness of a problem based on subset sum. Work of [[ZooRefs#AIK04|[AIK04] ]] shows pseudorandom generators in [[Class_NC0|$\text{NC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] under more relaxed assumptions.



[[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] contains [[Class_NC0|$\text{NC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], and is contained in [[Class_QAC0|$\text{QAC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] and [[Class_MAC0|$\text{MAC}^\text{0}\text{}$]].
