Same as SBP, except that f is a nonnegative-valued GapP function rather than a #P function.

Defined in [Vya03], where the following was also shown:

A,,0,,PP contains QMA, AWPP, and coC,,=,,P.
A,,0,,PP is contained in PP.
If A,,0,,PP = PP then PH is contained in PP.

Kuperberg ([Kup09]) showed that A,,0,,PP = SBQP.

Same as SBP, except that f is a GapP rather than #P function.
