The class of functions  which can be computed by  players with access to shared random bits in the number-on-forehead (defined as in P,,,,^cc^) model, subject to two constraints:



The communication cost (the sum of the number of random bits used and bits written to the shared blackboard) is .

 If , then the players decide correctly with probably at least 2/3, whereas if , the players always decide correctly.



[[Class_NPcc|$\text{NPcc}$]] is not equal to [[Class_RPcc|$\text{RPcc}$]] for  players, for any constant  [[ZooRefs#DP08|[DP08] ]].
