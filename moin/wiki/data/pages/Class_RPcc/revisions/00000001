The class of functions  which can be computed by  players with access to shared random bits in the number-on-forehead (defined as in P,,,,^cc^) model, subject to two constraints:

The communication cost (the sum of the number of random bits used and bits written to the shared blackboard) is .
 If , then the players decide correctly with probably at least 2/3, whereas if , the players always decide correctly.

NP,,,,^cc^ is not equal to RP,,,,^cc^ for  players, for any constant  [DP08].
