= MaxPB - MaxNP Polynomially Bounded =

== Comments ==

The subclass of [[Class_MaxNP|$\text{MaxNP}$]] problems for which the cost function is guaranteed always to be bounded by a polynomial.



[[Class_MinPB|$\text{MinPB}$]] can be defined similarly.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KT94|[KT94] ]].



The closure of [[Class_MaxPB|$\text{MaxPB}$]] under [[Class_PTAS|$\text{PTAS}$]] reductions equals [[Class_NPOPB|$\text{NPOPB}$]] [[ZooRefs#CKS+99|[CKS+99] ]].
