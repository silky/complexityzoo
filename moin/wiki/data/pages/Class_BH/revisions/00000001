The smallest class that contains NP and is closed under union, intersection, and complement.

The levels are defined as follows:

BH,,1,, = NP.
BH,,2i,, is the class of languages that are the intersection of a BH,,2i-1,, language with a coNP language.
BH,,2i+1,, is the class of languages that are the union of a BH,,2i,, language with an NP language.

Then BH is the union over all i of BH,,i,,.

Defined in [WW85].

For more detail see [CGH+88].

Contained in Δ,,2,,P and indeed in P^NP[log]^.

If BH collapses at any level, then PH collapses to Σ,,3,,P [Kad88].
