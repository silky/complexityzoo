Has the same relation to [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]] as [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#AR01|[AR01] ]], where it was shown that, if the Resolution proof system is automatizable (that is, if a refutation can always be found in time polynomial in the length of the shortest refutation), then [[Class_W[P]|$\text{W[P]}$]] is contained in [[Class_FPR|$\text{FPR}$]].



Has the same relation to [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]] as [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].
