The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that



If the answer is "no," then the number of accepting computation paths exactly equals the number of rejecting paths.

If the answer is "yes," then their difference exactly equals a function f(x) computable in polynomial time (i.e. FP).
