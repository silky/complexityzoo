Same as [[Class_REG|$\text{REG}$]], except that now the inputs are trees (say, binary trees) instead of strings.  Each vertex is labeled with a symbol from a fixed alphabet.  Evaluation begins at the leaves and proceeds to the root.  The state of the finite automaton at each vertex v is a function of (1) the states at v's children (if any), and (2) the symbol at v.  The tree is in the language if and only if the automaton is in an 'accept' state at the root.
