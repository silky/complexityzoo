[[ZooRefs#GSV99|[GSV99] ]] showed the following:



If [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]] does not equal [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] then [[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] does not equal [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]].

[[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] equals [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]] if and only if [[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] is closed under complement.

[[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] has natural complete promise problems:

  

    Statistical Distance from Uniform (SDU): Given a circuit, consider the distribution over outputs when the circuit is given a uniformly random n-bit string.  We're promised that the trace distance between this distribution and the uniform distribution is either at most 1/3 or at least 2/3.  The problem is to output "yes" in the former case and "no" in the latter.

    Entropy Approximation (EA): Now we're promised that the entropy of the circuit's output distribution is either at least k+1 or at most k-1.  The problem is to output "yes" in the former case and "no" in the latter.



[[Class_NIPZK|$\text{NIPZK}$]] can be defined similarly.
