= NISZK - Non-Interactive SZK =

== Comments ==

Defined in [DDP+98].

Contained in SZK.

[GSV99] showed the following:

If SZK does not equal BPP then NISZK does not equal BPP.
NISZK equals SZK if and only if NISZK is closed under complement.
NISZK has natural complete promise problems:
  
    Statistical Distance from Uniform (SDU): Given a circuit, consider the distribution over outputs when the circuit is given a uniformly random n-bit string.  We're promised that the trace distance between this distribution and the uniform distribution is either at most 1/3 or at least 2/3.  The problem is to output "yes" in the former case and "no" in the latter.
    Entropy Approximation (EA): Now we're promised that the entropy of the circuit's output distribution is either at least k+1 or at most k-1.  The problem is to output "yes" in the former case and "no" in the latter.

NIPZK can be defined similarly.
