== Comments ==

The class of all (possibly partial, possibly multivalued) functions computed by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine as follows: ignore the rejecting paths, and consider any output of an accepting path to be "one of the outputs."



Contains [[Class_NPSV|$\text{NPSV}$]] and [[Class_NPMVt|$\text{NPMVt}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BLS84|[BLS84] ]].



Contrast with [[Class_FNP|$\text{FNP}$]].
