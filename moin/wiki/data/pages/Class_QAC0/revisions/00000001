The class of decision problems solvable by a family of constant-depth, polynomial-size quantum circuits.  Here each layer of the circuit is a tensor product of one-qubit gates and Toffoli gates, or is a tensor product of controlled-NOT gates.



A uniformity condition may also be imposed.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Moo99|[Moo99] ]].



It is contained in [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QACf0}$]], but it is not known if it contains [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC0}$]]. Notice that the latter containment is not obvious, since the set of gates in [[Class_QAC0|$\text{QAC0}$]] do not allow to implement fanout in any way we may take for granted.



Contains [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC0}$]], and is contained in [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QACf0}$]].
