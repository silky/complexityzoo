The class of decision problems solvable by a family of constant-depth, polynomial-size quantum circuits.  Here each layer of the circuit is a tensor product of one-qubit gates and Toffoli gates, or is a tensor product of controlled-NOT gates.

A uniformity condition may also be imposed.

Defined in [Moo99].

It is contained in QAC,,f,,^0^, but it is not known if it contains AC^0^. Notice that the latter containment is not obvious, since the set of gates in QAC^0^ do not allow to implement fanout in any way we may take for granted.

Contains AC^0^, and is contained in QAC,,f,,^0^.
