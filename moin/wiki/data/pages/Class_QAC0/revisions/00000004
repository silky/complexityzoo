{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a family of constant-depth, polynomial-size quantum circuits.  Here each layer of the circuit is a tensor product of one-qubit gates and Toffoli gates, or is a tensor product of controlled-NOT gates.}}}

Defined in [[ZooRefs#Moo99|[Moo99] ]].



It is contained in [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QAC}_\text{f}\text{}^\text{0}\text{}$]], but it is not known if it contains [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]]. Notice that the latter containment is not obvious, since the set of gates in [[Class_QAC0|$\text{QAC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] do not allow to implement fanout in any way we may take for granted.



Contains [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], and is contained in [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QAC}_\text{f}\text{}^\text{0}\text{}$]].
