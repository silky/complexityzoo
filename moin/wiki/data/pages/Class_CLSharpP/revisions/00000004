{{{#!description

The class of [[Class_SharpP|$\text{#P}$]] function problems such that some underlying [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine $M$ witnessing membership in [[Class_SharpP|$\text{#P}$]] has}}}

== Complete Problem ==

== Comments ==

"clustered" accepting paths. That is:



There exists a polynomial p such that each computation path of M on each input x is exactly p(|x|) bits long.

There is a length-respecting total order A having polynomial-time computable adjacency checks on the computation paths of M.

The accepting paths of M on any input x are contiguous with respect to A.
