(Actually, I've since been informed that PINC means "Incremental Polynomial-Time.")

The class of function problems, f:{0,1}^n^->{0,1}^m^, such that the k^th^ output bit is computable in time polynomial in n and k.

Defined in [JY88].

Contained in PIO.  This containment is strict, since if m=2^n^ (say), then computing the first bit of f(x) might be EXP-complete.
