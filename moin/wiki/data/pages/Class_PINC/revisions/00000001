(Actually, I've since been informed that [[Class_PINC|$\text{PINC}$]] means "Incremental Polynomial-Time.")



The class of function problems, f:{0,1}^n^->{0,1}^m^, such that the k^th^ output bit is computable in time polynomial in n and k.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#JY88|[JY88] ]].



Contained in [[Class_PIO|$\text{PIO}$]].  This containment is strict, since if m=2^n^ (say), then computing the first bit of f(x) might be EXP-complete.
