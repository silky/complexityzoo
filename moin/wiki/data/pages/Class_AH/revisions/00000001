The analog of PH in computability theory.

Let Δ,,0,, = Σ,,0,, = Π,,0,, = R.  Then for i>0, let

Δ,,i,, = R with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.
Σ,,i,, = RE with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.
Π,,i,, = coRE with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.

Then AH is the union of these classes for all nonnegative constant i.

Each level of AH strictly contains the levels below it.

An equivalent definition is:  is the set of numbers decided by formula with one free variable and bounded quantifier, where the primitives are + and . A bounded quantifier is of the form  or  where   is considered to be free in . Then  is the sets of number validating a formula of the form  with .  is the set of formula who are negation of  formula.
