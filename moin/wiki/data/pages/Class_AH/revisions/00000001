The analog of [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] in computability theory.



Let Δ,,0,, = Σ,,0,, = Π,,0,, = [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]].  Then for i>0, let



Δ,,i,, = [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.

Σ,,i,, = [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]] with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.

Π,,i,, = [[Class_coRE|$\text{coRE}$]] with Σ,,i-1,, oracle.



Then [[Class_AH|$\text{AH}$]] is the union of these classes for all nonnegative constant i.



Each level of [[Class_AH|$\text{AH}$]] strictly contains the levels below it.



An equivalent definition is:  is the set of numbers decided by formula with one free variable and bounded quantifier, where the primitives are + and . A bounded quantifier is of the form  or  where   is considered to be free in . Then  is the sets of number validating a formula of the form  with .  is the set of formula who are negation of  formula.
