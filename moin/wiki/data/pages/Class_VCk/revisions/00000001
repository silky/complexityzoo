== Comments ==

For k = 0, VC,,0,, is the class of compressible languages.
 For k = 1, VC,,1,, is the class of languages that have local verification: they can be verified by testing only a small part of the instance. (Small means polynomial in the witness length and the log of the instance length.)
 For k ≥ 2, VC,,k,, is the class of languages that can be verified by a circuit of depth k, with size polynomial in the witness length and instance length.
