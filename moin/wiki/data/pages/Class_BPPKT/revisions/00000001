[[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] with an oracle that, given a string x, returns the minimum over all programs [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] that output x,,i,, on input i, of the length of [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] plus the maximum time taken by [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] on any input.



A similar class was defined in [[ZooRefs#ABK+02|[ABK+02] ]], where it was also shown that in [[Class_BPPKT|$\text{BPPKT}$]] one can factor, compute discrete logarithms, and more generally invert any one-way function on a non-negligible fraction of inputs.
