= BPP^KT^ - BPP With Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity Oracle =

== Comments ==

BPP with an oracle that, given a string x, returns the minimum over all programs P that output x,,i,, on input i, of the length of P plus the maximum time taken by P on any input.

A similar class was defined in [ABK+02], where it was also shown that in BPP^KT^ one can factor, compute discrete logarithms, and more generally invert any one-way function on a non-negligible fraction of inputs.
