Mod,,2,,P is more commonly known as [[Class_⊕P|$\text{⊕P}$]] "parity-P."



For every k, [[Class_ModkP|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{P}$]] contains graph isomorphism [[ZooRefs#AK02|[AK02] ]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#CH89|[CH89] ]], [[ZooRefs#Her90|[Her90] ]].



[[ZooRefs#Her90|[Her90] ]] and [[ZooRefs#BG92|[BG92] ]] showed that [[Class_ModkP|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{P}$]] is the set of unions of languages in Mod,,p,,P for each prime p that divides k.  In particular, if p is prime, then Mod,,p,,P = Mod,,p^m,,P for all positive integers m.  A further fact is that Mod,,p,,P is closed under union, intersection, and complement for p prime.



On the other hand, if k is not a prime power, then there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_ModkP|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{P}$]] is not closed under intersection or complement [[ZooRefs#BBR94|[BBR94] ]].



For prime p, there exists an oracle relative to which Mod,,p,,P does not contain [[Class_EQP|$\text{EQP}$]] [[ZooRefs#GV02|[GV02] ]].
