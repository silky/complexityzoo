For any k>1: The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that the number of accepting paths is divisible by k, if and only if the answer is "no."

Mod,,2,,P is more commonly known as âŠ•P "parity-P."

For every k, Mod,,k,,P contains graph isomorphism [AK02].

Defined in [CH89], [Her90].

[Her90] and [BG92] showed that Mod,,k,,P is the set of unions of languages in Mod,,p,,P for each prime p that divides k.  In particular, if p is prime, then Mod,,p,,P = Mod,,p^m,,P for all positive integers m.  A further fact is that Mod,,p,,P is closed under union, intersection, and complement for p prime.

On the other hand, if k is not a prime power, then there exists an oracle relative to which Mod,,k,,P is not closed under intersection or complement [BBR94].

For prime p, there exists an oracle relative to which Mod,,p,,P does not contain EQP [GV02].
