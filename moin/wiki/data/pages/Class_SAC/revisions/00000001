SAC^k^ is the class of decision problems solvable by a family of depth-O(log^k^n) circuits with unbounded-fanin OR & bounded-fanin AND gates.  Negations are only allowed at the input level.

A uniformity condition may also be imposed.

Defined by [BCD+89], who also showed that SAC,,k,, is closed under complement for every k>0.
