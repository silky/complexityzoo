== Comments ==

A distributional problem consists of a decision problem A, and a probability distribution μ over problem instances.

A function f, from strings to integers, is polynomial on μ-average if there exists a constant ε>0 such that the expectation of f^ε^(x) is finite, when x is drawn from μ.

Then (A,μ) is in AvgP if there is an algorithm for A whose running time is polynomial on μ-average.

This convoluted definition is due to Levin [Lev86], who realized that simpler definitions lead to classes that fail to satisfy basic closure properties.  Also see [Gol97] for more information.

If AvgP = DistNP then EXP = NEXP [BCG+92].

Strictly contained in HeurP [NS05].
