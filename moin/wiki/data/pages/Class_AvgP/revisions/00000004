{{{#!description

A distributional problem consists of a decision problem A, and a probability distribution μ over problem instances.}}}

A function f, from strings to integers, is polynomial on μ-average if there exists a constant ε>0 such that the expectation of f^ε^(x) is finite, when x is drawn from μ.



Then (A,μ) is in [[Class_AvgP|$\text{AvgP}$]] if there is an algorithm for A whose running time is polynomial on μ-average.



This convoluted definition is due to Levin [[ZooRefs#Lev86|[Lev86] ]], who realized that simpler definitions lead to classes that fail to satisfy basic closure properties.  Also see [[ZooRefs#Gol97|[Gol97] ]] for more information.



If [[Class_AvgP|$\text{AvgP}$]] = [[Class_DistNP|$\text{DistNP}$]] then [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#BCG+92|[BCG+92] ]].



Strictly contained in [[Class_HeurP|$\text{HeurP}$]] [[ZooRefs#NS05|[NS05] ]].
