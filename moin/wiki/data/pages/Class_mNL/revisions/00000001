See mP for the definition of a monotone nondeterministic Turing machine, due to [GS90].

mNL is the class of decision problems solvable by a monotone nondeterministic log-space Turing machine.

mNL does not equal mcoNL [GS90], in contrast to the case for NL and coNL.

Also, mNL strictly contains mNC^1^ [KW88].
