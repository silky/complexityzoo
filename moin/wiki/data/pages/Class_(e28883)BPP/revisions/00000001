The class of problems for which there exists a [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine M such that, for all inputs x,}}}

If the answer is "yes" then there exists a y such that M(x,y) accepts.

If the answer is "no" then for all y, M(x,y) rejects.



Alternatively defined as NP^BPP^.



Contains [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] and [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]], and is contained in [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] and [[Class_SBP|$\text{SBP}$]].



[[Class_∃BPP|$\text{∃BPP}$]] seems obviously equal to [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]], yet [[ZooRefs#FFK+93|[FFK+93] ]] constructed an oracle relative to which they're unequal!  Here is the difference: if the answer is "yes," [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] requires only that there exist a y such that for at least 2/3 of random strings r, M(x,y,r) accepts (where M is a [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] predicate).  For all other y's, the proportion of r's such that M(x,y,r) accepts can be arbitrary (say, 1/2).  For [[Class_∃BPP|$\text{∃BPP}$]], by contrast, the probability that M(x,y) accepts must always be either at most 1/3 or at least 2/3, for all y's.
