A quantum branching program is the natural quantum generalization: we have a quantum state in a Hilbert space of dimension k.  Each step t consists of applying a unitary matrix U^(t)^(x,,i,,): that is, U^(t)^ depends on a single bit x,,i,, of the input.  (So these are the quantum analogues of so-called oblivious branching programs.)  In the end we measure to decide whether to accept; there must be zero probability of error.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#AMP02|[AMP02] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_NC1|$\text{NC}^\text{1}\text{}$]] is contained in 2-EQBP.



k-BQBP can be defined similarly.
