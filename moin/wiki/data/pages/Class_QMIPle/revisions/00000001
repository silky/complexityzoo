== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_QMIP|$\text{QMIP}$]], except that now the provers share only a polynomial number of EPR pairs, instead of an unlimited number.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KM02|[KM02] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_QMIPle|$\text{QMIPle}$]] is contained in [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] = [[Class_QMIPne|$\text{QMIPne}$]].
