= AxPP - Approximable in Probabilistic Polynomial Time =

Usually called [[Class_APP|$\text{APP}$]].  I've renamed it [[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] to distinguish it from the "other" [[Class_APP|$\text{APP}$]].



The class of real-valued functions from {0,1}^n^ to [0,1] that can be approximated within any ε>0 by a probabilistic Turing machine in time polynomial in n and 1/ε.



Defined by [[ZooRefs#KRC00|[KRC00] ]], who also show the following:



Approximating the acceptance probability of a Boolean circuit is AxPP-complete.  The authors argue that this makes [[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] a more natural class than [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]], since the latter is not believed to have complete problems.

If [[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] = [[Class_AxP|$\text{AxP}$]], then [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] = [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].

On the other hand, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] = [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] but [[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] does not equal [[Class_AxP|$\text{AxP}$]].



[[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] is recursively enumerable [Jeř07].



Interestingly, it is unclear whether the set of [[Class_AxPP|$\text{AxPP}$]] machines is in [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]].
