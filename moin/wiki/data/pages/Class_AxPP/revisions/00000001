= AxPP - Approximable in Probabilistic Polynomial Time =

== Comments ==

Usually called APP.  I've renamed it AxPP to distinguish it from the "other" APP.

The class of real-valued functions from {0,1}^n^ to [0,1] that can be approximated within any ε>0 by a probabilistic Turing machine in time polynomial in n and 1/ε.

Defined by [KRC00], who also show the following:

Approximating the acceptance probability of a Boolean circuit is AxPP-complete.  The authors argue that this makes AxPP a more natural class than BPP, since the latter is not believed to have complete problems.
If AxPP = AxP, then BPP = P.
On the other hand, there exists an oracle relative to which BPP = P but AxPP does not equal AxP.

AxPP is recursively enumerable [Jeř07].

Interestingly, it is unclear whether the set of AxPP machines is in RE.
