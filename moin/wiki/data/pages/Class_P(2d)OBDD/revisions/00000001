= P-OBDD - Polynomial-Size Ordered Binary Decision Diagram =

== Comments ==

An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a branching program (see k-PBP), with the additional constraint that if x,,i,, is queried before x,,j,, on any path, then i<j.



Then [[Class_P-OBDD|$\text{P-OBDD}$]] is the class of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size OBDD's.



Contained in [[Class_PBP|$\text{PBP}$]], as well as [[Class_BPP-OBDD|$\text{BPP-OBDD}$]].
