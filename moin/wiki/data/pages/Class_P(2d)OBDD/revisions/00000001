= P-OBDD - Polynomial-Size Ordered Binary Decision Diagram =

== Comments ==

An ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) is a branching program (see k-PBP), with the additional constraint that if x,,i,, is queried before x,,j,, on any path, then i<j.

Then P-OBDD is the class of decision problems solvable by polynomial-size OBDD's.

Contained in PBP, as well as BPP-OBDD.
