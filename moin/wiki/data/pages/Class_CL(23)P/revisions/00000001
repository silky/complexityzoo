The class of #P function problems such that some underlying NP machine  witnessing membership in #P has
"clustered" accepting paths. That is:

There exists a polynomial  such that each computation path of  on each input  is exactly  bits long.
There is a length-respecting total order  having polynomial-time computable adjacency checks on the computation paths of .
The accepting paths of  on any input  are contiguous with respect to .
