A class of number-theoretic functions, defined as the closure of basic integer arithmetic operations ($+, -, \cdot, \lfloor x/y\rfloor$, as well as constants 0, 1, and projections) under composition and polynomially long sums and products. Defined by [[ZooRefs#Con73|[Con73] ]], who mistakenly claimed it coincides with [[Class_FP|$\text{FP}$]].}}}
