{{{#!description

The class of decision problems for which there's a polynomial-time algorithm with the following property.  Whenever it's given two instances, a "yes" and a "no" instance, the algorithm can always decide which is the "yes" instance.}}}

Defined in [[ZooRefs#Sel79|[Sel79] ]], where it was also shown that if [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is contained in [[Class_P-Sel|$\text{P-Sel}$]] then [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].



There exist P-selective sets that are not recursive (i.e. not in [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]]).
