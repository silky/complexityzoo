= R,,H,,L - Randomized Halting Logarithmic-Space =

== Comments ==

Has the same relation to [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] as [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].  The randomized machine must halt for every input and every setting of the random tape.



Contains undirected reachability (is there a path from vertex u to vertex v in an undirected graph?) [[ZooRefs#AKL+79|[AKL+79] ]].



Contained in [[Class_RL|$\text{RL}$]].
