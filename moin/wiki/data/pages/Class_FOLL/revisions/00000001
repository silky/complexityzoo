== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of polynomial-size, unbounded-fanin, depth O(log log n) circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates. Equals FO(log log n).

Defined in [BKL+00], where it was also shown that many problems on finite groups are in FOLL.

Contains uniform AC^0^, and is contained in uniform AC^1^.

Is not known to be comparable to L or NL.
