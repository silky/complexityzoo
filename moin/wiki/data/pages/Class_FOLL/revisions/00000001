== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a uniform family of polynomial-size, unbounded-fanin, depth O(log log n) circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates. Equals FO(log log n).}}}

== Comments ==



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BKL+00|[BKL+00] ]], where it was also shown that many problems on finite groups are in [[Class_FOLL|$\text{FOLL}$]].



Contains uniform [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]], and is contained in uniform [[Class_AC1|$\text{AC}^\text{1}\text{}$]].



Is not known to be comparable to [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] or [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]].
