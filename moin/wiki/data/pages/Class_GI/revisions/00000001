Can be defined as the class of problems polynomial-time Turing reducible to the Graph Isomorphism problem.}}}

Contains [[Class_GA|$\text{GA}$]] and is contained in [[Class_Δ2P|$\text{Δ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]].



The Graph Isomorphism problem itself (as opposed to the set of problems Turing reducible to Graph Isomorphism) is contained in [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] as well as [[Class_coAM|$\text{coAM}$]] (and indeed [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]]).  So in particular, if Graph Isomorphism is NP-complete, then [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] collapses.

Can be defined as the class of problems polynomial-time Turing reducible to the problem of deciding whether two graphs are isomorphic.
