= Almost-PSPACE - Languages Almost Surely in PSPACEA =

== Comments ==

The class of problems that are in PSPACE^A^ with probability 1, where A is an oracle chosen uniformly at random.

Almost-PSPACE is not known to equal PSPACE -- rather surprisingly, given the fact that PSPACE equals BPPSPACE and even PPSPACE.

What's known is that Almost-PSPACE = BP^exp^•PSPACE, where BP^exp^• is like the BP• operator but with exponentially-long strings [BVW98].  It follows that Almost-PSPACE is contained in NEXP^NP^ ∩ coNEXP^NP^.

Whereas both BP^exp^•PSPACE and BPPSPACE machines are allowed exponentially many random bits, the former has a reusable record of all of these bits on a witness tape, while the latter can only preserve a fraction of them on the work tape.
