[[Class_Almost-PSPACE|$\text{Almost-PSPACE}$]] is not known to equal [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] -- rather surprisingly, given the fact that [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] equals BPPSPACE and even [[Class_PPSPACE|$\text{PPSPACE}$]].



What's known is that [[Class_Almost-PSPACE|$\text{Almost-PSPACE}$]] = BP^exp^•PSPACE, where BP^exp^• is like the BP• operator but with exponentially-long strings [[ZooRefs#BVW98|[BVW98] ]].  It follows that [[Class_Almost-PSPACE|$\text{Almost-PSPACE}$]] is contained in NEXP^NP^ ∩ coNEXP^NP^.



Whereas both BP^exp^•PSPACE and BPPSPACE machines are allowed exponentially many random bits, the former has a reusable record of all of these bits on a witness tape, while the latter can only preserve a fraction of them on the work tape.
