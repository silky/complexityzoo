Defined in [M08] based on [DDPY98],[BFM88].

Contained in PZK.

[M08] showed a complete promise-problem for NIPZK, called Unifrom (UN). Instances 
in UN are circuits with n+1 output bits. The first n bits represent the uniform distribution, and the last bit is 1 with probability at least 2/3. For instances not in UN, when the last bit is 1, at most 1/3 of the strings of length n can appear as the output of the circuit. The problem is to decide which is the case.
