Same as compNP but for interactive (IP) proofs instead of NP proofs.

More formally, compIP is the class of decision problems L in IP = PSPACE such that, if the answer is "yes," then that can be proven by an interactive protocol between a BPP verifier and a prover, a BPP machine with access only to an oracle for L.

Assuming NEE is not contained in BPEE, NP (and indeed NP âˆ© Coh) is not contained in compIP [BG94].
