= BPQP - Bounded-Error Probabilistic QP =

== Comments ==

Equals BPTIME(2^O((log n)^k)^); that is, the class of problems solvable in quasipolynomial-time on a bounded-error machine.

Defined in [CNS99], where the following was also shown:

If either (1) #P does not have a subexponential-time bounded-error algorithm, or (2) EXP does not have subexponential-size circuits, then the BPQP hierarchy is strict -- that is, for all a < b at least 1, BPTIME(2^(log n)^a^) is strictly contained in BPTIME(2^(log n)^b^).
