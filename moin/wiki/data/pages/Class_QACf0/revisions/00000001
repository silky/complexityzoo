Same as [[Class_QAC0|$\text{QAC0}$]], except that an additional "quantum fanout" gate is available, which CNOT's a qubit into arbitrarily many target qubits in a single step.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Moo99|[Moo99] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_QACf0|$\text{QACf0}$]] =

QAC^0^[2] = [[Class_QACC0|$\text{QACC0}$]].
