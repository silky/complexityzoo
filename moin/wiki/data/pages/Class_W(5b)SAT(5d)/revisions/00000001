The class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are fixed-parameter reducible to the following problem, for some constant h:

Weighted SAT: Given a Boolean formula F (with no restriction on depth), does F have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight k?

See W[1] for the definition of fixed-parameter reducibility.

Defined in [DF99].

Contains W[t] for every t, and is contained in W[P].
