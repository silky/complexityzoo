If the answer is "yes," then there exists a quantum state ρ such that for all quantum states σ, M(ρ,Ï) accepts with probability at least 2/3.

If the answer is "no," then there exists a σ such that for all ρ, M(ρ,σ) rejects with probability at least 2/3.



In other words, it's the same as [[Class_SQG|$\text{SQG}$]], but without communication from the verifier back to the provers.



Contains [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] (and indeed P^QMA^), and is contained in [[Class_SQG|$\text{SQG}$]] and hence [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].
