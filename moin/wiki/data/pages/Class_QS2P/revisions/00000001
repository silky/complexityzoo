The class of problems for which there exists a BQP machine M such that:

If the answer is "yes," then there exists a quantum state ρ such that for all quantum states σ, M(ρ,Ï) accepts with probability at least 2/3.
If the answer is "no," then there exists a σ such that for all ρ, M(ρ,σ) rejects with probability at least 2/3.

In other words, it's the same as SQG, but without communication from the verifier back to the provers.

Contains QMA (and indeed P^QMA^), and is contained in SQG and hence EXP.
