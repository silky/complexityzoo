= SO[] - Iterated Second-Order logic =

== Comments ==

SO[] is to SO what FO[] is to FO. But we now also have second-order quantifier in the quantifier block.

In Descriptive complexity we can see that :

SO[] is  equal to PSPACE it is also another way to write SO(TC)
SO[] is equal to EXPTIME it is also another way to write SO(LFP)
