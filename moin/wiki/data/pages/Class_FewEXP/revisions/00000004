== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] machine such that, given a "yes" instance, no more than an exponential number of computation paths accept.}}}

Contained in MIP[NP^FewEXP^] ([[Class_MIP|$\text{MIP}$]] where provers are not unbounded in computational power, but are limited to NP^FewEXP^) [[ZooRefs#AKS+94|[AKS+94] ]].



Alternatively, [[Class_FewEXP|$\text{FewEXP}$]] can refer to the sparsity of accepting paths in a given instance. In [[ZooRefs#AKR+03|[AKR+03] ]], the authors show that the conjectures "FewEXP search instances are EXP-solvable" and "FewEXP decision instances are EXP/poly-solvable" are equivalent. That is, for all [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] machines $N$, the following conditions are equivalent:



There exists an [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] machine M such that if given a string x, N(x) accepts and has exponentially bounded accepting paths, then M(x) produces one such path.

 There exists an [[Class_EXP/poly|$\text{EXP/poly}$]] machine M which accepts a string x if and only N(x) accepts.
