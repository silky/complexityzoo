Usually called AP in the literature.  I've renamed it AxP to distinguish it from the "other" AP.

The class of real-valued functions from {0,1}^n^ to [0,1] that can be approximated within any ε>0 by a deterministic Turing machine in time polynomial in n and 1/ε.

Defined by [KRC00], who also showed that the set of AxP machines is in RE.
