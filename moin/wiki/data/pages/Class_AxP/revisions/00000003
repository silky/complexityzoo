== Description ==

{{{#!description

Usually called [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] in the literature.  I've renamed it [[Class_AxP|$\text{AxP}$]] to distinguish it from the "other" [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]].}}}

== Comments ==



The class of real-valued functions from {0,1}^n^ to [0,1] that can be approximated within any ε>0 by a deterministic Turing machine in time polynomial in n and 1/ε.



Defined by [[ZooRefs#KRC00|[KRC00] ]], who also showed that the set of [[Class_AxP|$\text{AxP}$]] machines is in [[Class_RE|$\text{RE}$]].
