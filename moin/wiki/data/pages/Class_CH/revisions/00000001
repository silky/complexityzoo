The union of the C,,k,,P's over all constant k.

Contained in PSPACE.

Strictly contains DLOGTIME-uniform NC^1^ [CMTV98].

It is an open problem whether there exists an oracle relative to which CH is infinite, or even unequal to PSPACE.  This is closely related to the problem of whether TC^0^ = NC^1^, since a padding argument shows that TC^0^ = NC^1^ implies CH = PSPACE.
