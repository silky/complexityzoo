The class of decision problems solvable by a Merlin-Arthur protocol, which goes as follows.  Merlin, who has unbounded computational resources, sends Arthur a polynomial-size purported proof that the answer to the problem is "yes."  Arthur must verify the proof in BPP (i.e. probabilistic polynomial-time), so that

If the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with probability at least 2/3.
If the answer is "no," then for all proofs Arthur accepts with probability at most 1/3.

An alternative definition requires that if the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with certainty.  However, the definitions with one-sided and two-sided error can be shown to be equivalent (see [FGM+89]).

Contains NP and BPP 
(in fact also ∃BPP), and is contained in AM and in QMA.

Also contained in Σ,,2,,P ∩ Π,,2,,P.

There exists an oracle relative to which BQP is not in MA [Wat00].

Equals NP under a derandomization assumption: if E requires exponentially-sized circuits, then PromiseBPP = PromiseP, implying that MA = NP [IW97].

Shown in [San07] that MA/1 does not have circuits of size  for any . In the same paper, the result was used to show that MA/1 cannot be solved on more than a  fraction of inputs having length  by any circuit of size . Finally, it was shown that MA does not have arithmetic circuits of size .

An alternative definition requires that if the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with certainty.  However, the definitions with one-sided and two-sided error can be shown to be equivalent (exercise for the Zoo visitor).
