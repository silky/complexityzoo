{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a Merlin-Arthur protocol, which goes as follows.  Merlin, who has unbounded computational resources, sends Arthur a polynomial-size purported proof that the answer to the problem is "yes."  Arthur must verify the proof in [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] (i.e. probabilistic polynomial-time), so that}}}

If the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with probability at least 2/3.

If the answer is "no," then for all proofs Arthur accepts with probability at most 1/3.



An alternative definition requires that if the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with certainty.  However, the definitions with one-sided and two-sided error can be shown to be equivalent (see [[ZooRefs#FGM+89|[FGM+89] ]]).



Contains [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] and [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] 

(in fact also [[Class_∃BPP|$\text{∃BPP}$]]), and is contained in [[Class_AM|$\text{AM}$]] and in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].



Also contained in [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] ∩ [[Class_Π2P|$\text{Π}_\text{2}\text{P}$]].



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] is not in [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] [[ZooRefs#Wat00|[Wat00] ]].



Equals [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] under a derandomization assumption: if [[Class_E|$\text{E}$]] requires exponentially-sized circuits, then [[Class_PromiseBPP|$\text{PromiseBPP}$]] = [[Class_PromiseP|$\text{PromiseP}$]], implying that [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#IW97|[IW97] ]].



Shown in [[ZooRefs#San07|[San07] ]] that MA/1 does not have circuits of size $n^k$ for any $k>0$. In the same paper, the result was used to show that MA/1 cannot be solved on more than a $1/2 + 1/{n^k}$ fraction of inputs having length $n$ by any circuit of size $n^k$. Finally, it was shown that [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] does not have arithmetic circuits of size $n^k$.

An alternative definition requires that if the answer is "yes," then there exists a proof such that Arthur accepts with certainty.  However, the definitions with one-sided and two-sided error can be shown to be equivalent (exercise for the Zoo visitor).
