The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine that simultaneously uses polynomial time and polylogarithmic space.



Note that [[Class_SC|$\text{SC}$]] might be smaller than [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] âˆ© [[Class_polyL|$\text{polyL}$]], since for the latter, it suffices to have two separate algorithms: one polynomial-time and the other polylogarithmic-space.



Deterministic context-free languages (DCFLs) can be recognized in [[Class_SC|$\text{SC}$]] [[ZooRefs#Coo79|[Coo79] ]].



[[Class_SC|$\text{SC}$]] contains [[Class_RL|$\text{RL}$]] and [[Class_BPL|$\text{BPL}$]] [[ZooRefs#Nis92|[Nis92] ]].



[[Class_SC|$\text{SC}$]] equals DTISP(poly,polylog) by definition.
