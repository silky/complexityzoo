(Named in honor of Stephen Cook.)

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine that simultaneously uses polynomial time and polylogarithmic space.

Note that SC might be smaller than P âˆ© polyL, since for the latter, it suffices to have two separate algorithms: one polynomial-time and the other polylogarithmic-space.

Deterministic context-free languages (DCFLs) can be recognized in SC [Coo79].

SC contains RL and BPL [Nis92].

SC equals DTISP(poly,polylog) by definition.
