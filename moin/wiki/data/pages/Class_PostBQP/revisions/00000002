Formally, the class of decision problems solvable by a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine such that



If the answer is 'yes' then the second qubit has at least 2/3 probability of being measured 1, conditioned on the first qubit having been measured 1.

If the answer is 'no' then the second qubit has at most 1/3 probability of being measured 1, conditioned on the first qubit having been measured 1.

On any input, the first qubit has a nonzero probability of being measured 1.



Defined in [Aar05b], where it is also shown that [[Class_PostBQP|$\text{PostBQP}$]] equals [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]].



[Aar05b] also gives the following alternate characterizations of [[Class_PostBQP|$\text{PostBQP}$]] (and therefore of [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]]):



The quantum analogue of [[Class_BPPpath|$\text{BPP}_\text{path}\text{}$]].

The class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial time if we allow arbitrary linear operations (not just unitary ones). Before measuring, we divide all amplitudes by a normalizing factor to make the probabilities sum to 1.

The class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial time if we take the probability of measuring a basis state with amplitude α to be not |α|^2^ but |α|^p^, where p is an even integer greater than 2.  (Again we need to divide all amplitudes by a normalizing factor to make the probabilities sum to 1.)
