A class inspired by the proverb, "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."

Formally, the class of decision problems solvable by a BQP machine such that

If the answer is 'yes' then the second qubit has at least 2/3 probability of being measured 1, conditioned on the first qubit having been measured 1.
If the answer is 'no' then the second qubit has at most 1/3 probability of being measured 1, conditioned on the first qubit having been measured 1.
On any input, the first qubit has a nonzero probability of being measured 1.

Defined in [Aar05b], where it is also shown that PostBQP equals PP.

[Aar05b] also gives the following alternate characterizations of PostBQP (and therefore of PP):

The quantum analogue of BPP,,path,,.
The class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial time if we allow arbitrary linear operations (not just unitary ones). Before measuring, we divide all amplitudes by a normalizing factor to make the probabilities sum to 1.
The class of problems solvable in quantum polynomial time if we take the probability of measuring a basis state with amplitude α to be not |α|^2^ but |α|^p^, where p is an even integer greater than 2.  (Again we need to divide all amplitudes by a normalizing factor to make the probabilities sum to 1.)
