The class of fixed point problems. In the framework of fixed point problems, an instance I is associated with a (continuous) function F,,I,,, and a solution of I is a fixed point of F,,I,,.

Properties of FIXP problems:

the function F,,I,, is represented by an algebraic circuit over {+, -, *, /, max, min} with rational constants
 there is a polynomial time algorithm that computes the circuit from I.

Every FIXP problem has Partial Computation, Decision, (Strong) Approximation, and Existence counterparts; these can all be solved in PSPACE.

The Nash equilibrium problem for 3 or more players is FIXP-complete.

Linear-FIXP = PPAD.
