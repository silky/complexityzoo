== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of fixed point problems. In the framework of fixed point problems, an instance I is associated with a (continuous) function F,,I,,, and a solution of I is a fixed point of F,,I,,.}}}

Properties of [[Class_FIXP|$\text{FIXP}$]] problems:



the function F,,I,, is represented by an algebraic circuit over {+, -, *, /, max, min} with rational constants

 there is a polynomial time algorithm that computes the circuit from I.



Every [[Class_FIXP|$\text{FIXP}$]] problem has Partial Computation, Decision, (Strong) Approximation, and Existence counterparts; these can all be solved in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]].



The Nash equilibrium problem for 3 or more players is FIXP-complete.



Linear-FIXP = [[Class_PPAD|$\text{PPAD}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#EY07|[EY07] ]].
