== Description ==

{{{#!description

A Turing machine with random access owns a special tape where it can write a binary number $n$, and it can query the value of the $n$th bit of the input. Hence any bit of the input can be read in only logtime.}}}

The $i$th level of the Logarithmic Time Hierarchy is the set of languages recognised by alternating Turing machine in logtime with random access and $i-1$ alternation, begining with existantial state. [[Class_LH|$\text{LH}$]] is the union of all levels and is equal to tothe class [[Class_AC0|$\text{AC}^\text{0}\text{}$]] and to [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]] Descriptive complexity.
