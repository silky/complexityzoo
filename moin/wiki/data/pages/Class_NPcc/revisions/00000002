== Description ==

{{{#!description

The analogue of [[Class_Pcc|$\text{P}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] for nondeterministic communication complexity.  Both communication bits and nondeterministic guess bits count toward the complexity.}}}

== Comments ==



Does not equal [[Class_Pcc|$\text{P}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] or [[Class_coNPcc|$\text{coNP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] because of the EQUALITY problem.  Also, does not contain [[Class_BPPcc|$\text{BPP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] because of that problem.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BFS86|[BFS86] ]].



Contained in [[Class_PHcc|$\text{PH}^\text{cc}\text{}$]].
