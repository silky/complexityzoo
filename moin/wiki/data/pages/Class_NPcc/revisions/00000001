= NP^cc^ - Communication Complexity NP =

== Comments ==

The analogue of P^cc^ for nondeterministic communication complexity.  Both communication bits and nondeterministic guess bits count toward the complexity.

Does not equal P^cc^ or coNP^cc^ because of the EQUALITY problem.  Also, does not contain BPP^cc^ because of that problem.

Defined in [BFS86].

Contained in PH^cc^.

Has the same relation to NP^cc^ and NP as P,,,,^cc^ does to P^cc^ and P.

NP,,,,^cc^ is not contained in BPP,,,,^cc^ for  players, for any constant . As a result, NP,,,,^cc^ is not equal to RP,,,,^cc^ under the same conditions [DP08].
