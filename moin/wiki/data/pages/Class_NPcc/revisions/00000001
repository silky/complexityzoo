== Comments ==

The analogue of [[Class_Pcc|$\text{Pcc}$]] for nondeterministic communication complexity.  Both communication bits and nondeterministic guess bits count toward the complexity.



Does not equal [[Class_Pcc|$\text{Pcc}$]] or [[Class_coNPcc|$\text{coNPcc}$]] because of the EQUALITY problem.  Also, does not contain [[Class_BPPcc|$\text{BPPcc}$]] because of that problem.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BFS86|[BFS86] ]].



Contained in [[Class_PHcc|$\text{PHcc}$]].



Has the same relation to [[Class_NPcc|$\text{NPcc}$]] and [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] as [[Class_Pcc|$\text{Pcc}$]] does to [[Class_Pcc|$\text{Pcc}$]] and [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



[[Class_NPcc|$\text{NPcc}$]] is not contained in [[Class_BPPcc|$\text{BPPcc}$]] for  players, for any constant . As a result, [[Class_NPcc|$\text{NPcc}$]] is not equal to [[Class_RPcc|$\text{RPcc}$]] under the same conditions [[ZooRefs#DP08|[DP08] ]].
