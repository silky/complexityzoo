The class of problems that can be decided in quasi-linear time by a multitape nondeterministic Turing machine.  Quasi-linear here means n(log n)^k^ + k, for some k.

Equals NNLT.

SAT is NQL-complete under quasi-linear-time reductions (which can be computed in deterministic quasi-linear time) [Sch78].

Defined in [Sch78].
