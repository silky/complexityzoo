== Description ==

{{{#!description

The subclass of [[Class_NPO|$\text{NPO}$]] problems that admit an approximation scheme in the following sense.  For any ε>0, there is an algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution whose cost is within a 1+ε factor of the optimum cost.  Furthermore, the running time of the algorithm is polynomial in n (the size of the problem) and in 1/ε.}}}
