Along with [[Class_Π2P|$\text{Π}_\text{2}\text{P}$]], comprises the second level of [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]], the polynomial hierarchy.



[[ZooRefs#Uma98|[Uma98] ]] has shown that the following problems are complete for [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]]:



Minimum equivalent DNF.  Given a DNF formula F and integer k, is there a DNF formula equivalent to F with k or fewer occurences of literals?

Shortest implicant.  Given a formula F and integer k, is there a conjunction of k or fewer literals that implies F?  (Note that this problem cannot be Σ,,2,,P-complete for DNF formulas unless [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] equals βP^NP^.)



For any fixed k, there is a problem in [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] ∩ [[Class_Π2P|$\text{Π}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] that cannot be solved by circuits of size n^k^ [[ZooRefs#Kan82|[Kan82] ]].
