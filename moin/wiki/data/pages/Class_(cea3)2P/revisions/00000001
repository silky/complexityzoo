Complement of Π,,2,,P.

Along with Π,,2,,P, comprises the second level of PH, the polynomial hierarchy.

[Uma98] has shown that the following problems are complete for Σ,,2,,P:

Minimum equivalent DNF.  Given a DNF formula F and integer k, is there a DNF formula equivalent to F with k or fewer occurences of literals?
Shortest implicant.  Given a formula F and integer k, is there a conjunction of k or fewer literals that implies F?  (Note that this problem cannot be Σ,,2,,P-complete for DNF formulas unless Σ,,2,,P equals βP^NP^.)

For any fixed k, there is a problem in Σ,,2,,P ∩ Π,,2,,P that cannot be solved by circuits of size n^k^ [Kan82].
