β,,k,,P is the class of decision problems solvable by a polynomial-time Turing machine that makes O(log^k^n) nondeterministic transitions, with the same acceptance mechanism as NP.  Equivalently, the machine receives a purported proof of size O(log^k^n) that the answer is 'yes.'

Then βP is the union of β,,k,,P over all constant k.

Defined in [KF84].  See also the survey [GLM96].

There exist oracles relative to which basically any consistent inclusion structure among the β,,k,,P's can be realized [BG98].

β,,2,,P contains LOGNP and LOGSNP.
