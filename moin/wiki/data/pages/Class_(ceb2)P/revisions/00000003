== Description ==

{{{#!description

β,,k,,P is the class of decision problems solvable by a polynomial-time Turing machine that makes O(log^k^n) nondeterministic transitions, with the same acceptance mechanism as [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].  Equivalently, the machine receives a purported proof of size O(log^k^n) that the answer is 'yes.'}}}

== Comments ==



Then [[Class_βP|$\text{βP}$]] is the union of β,,k,,P over all constant k.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KF84|[KF84] ]].  See also the survey [[ZooRefs#GLM96|[GLM96] ]].



There exist oracles relative to which basically any consistent inclusion structure among the β,,k,,P's can be realized [[ZooRefs#BG98|[BG98] ]].



β,,2,,P contains [[Class_LOGNP|$\text{LOGNP}$]] and [[Class_LOGSNP|$\text{LOGSNP}$]].
