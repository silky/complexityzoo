= Few - FewP With Flexible Acceptance Mechanism =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that



The number of accepting paths a is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input x.

For some polynomial-time predicate [[Class_Q|$\text{Q}$]], Q(x,a) is true if and only if the answer is 'yes.'



Also called FewPaths.
