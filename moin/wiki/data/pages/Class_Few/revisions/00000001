The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

The number of accepting paths a is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input x.
For some polynomial-time predicate Q, Q(x,a) is true if and only if the answer is 'yes.'

Also called FewPaths.

Defined in [CH89].

Contains FewP, and is contained in P^FewP^ [Kob89] and in SPP [FFK94].
