= LOGNP - Logarithmically-Restricted NP =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems expressible in logical form as

The set of I for which there exists a subset S={s,,1,,,...,s,,log n,,} of {1,...,n} of size log n, such that for all x there exists y such that for all j in S, the predicate φ(I,s,,j,,,x,y,j) holds.  Here x and y are logarithmic-length strings, or equivalently polynomially bounded numbers, and φ is computable in P.

LOGNP,,0,, is the subclass in which φ is a first-order predicate without quantifiers and x and y are bounded lists of indices of input bits.  LOGNP is also the closure of LOGNP,,0,, under many-one reduction.

The motivation is that the analogue of LOGNP,,0,, without the logarithmic bound on |S| is SO-E, which by Fagin's theorem equals NP [Fag74].

Defined in [PY96], where it was also shown that the following problem is complete for LOGNP under many-one reductions:

Vapnik-Chervonenkis (V-C) Dimension.  Given a family F of subsets of a set U, find a subset of S of U of maximum cardinality, such that every subset of S can be written as the intersection of S with some set in F.

Contains LOGSNP, and is contained in βP (indeed β,,2,,P).
