== Comments ==

The class of problems for which a 1-1/poly(n) fraction of instances are solvable by a [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine.



[[ZooRefs#FS04|[FS04] ]] showed a strict hierarchy theorem for [[Class_HeurBPP|$\text{HeurBPP}$]]; thus, [[Class_HeurBPP|$\text{HeurBPP}$]] does not equal HeurBPTIME(n^c^) for any fixed c.
