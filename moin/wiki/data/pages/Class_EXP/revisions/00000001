Equals the union of DTIME(2^p(n)^) over all polynomials p.

Also equals P with E oracle.

If L = P then PSPACE = EXP.

If EXP is in P/poly then EXP = MA [BFL91].

Problems complete for EXP under many-one reductions have measure 0 in EXP [May94], [JL95].

There exist oracles relative to which

EXP = NP = ZPP [Hel84a], [Hel84b], [Kur85], [Hel86],
EXP = NEXP but still P does not equal NP [Dek76],
EXP does not equal PSPACE [Dek76].

[BT04] show the following rather striking result: let A be many-one complete for EXP, and let S be any set in P of subexponential density.  Then A-S is Turing-complete for EXP.

[SM03] show that if EXP has circuits of polynomial size, then P can be simulated in MA,,POLYLOG,, such that no deterministic polynomial-time adversary can generate a list of inputs for a P problem that includes one which fails to be simulated. As a result, EXP âŠ† MA if EXP has circuits of polynomial size.

[SU05] show that EXP  NP/poly implies EXP  P^||NP^/poly.

In descriptive complexity EXPTIME can be defined as SO() which is also SO(LFP)

EXP = NP = ZPP [Hel84],
EXP = NEXP but still P does not equal NP [Dek76],
EXP does not equal PSPACE [Dek76].
