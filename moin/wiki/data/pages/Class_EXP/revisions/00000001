Also equals [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] with [[Class_E|$\text{E}$]] oracle.



If [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]] = [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] then [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] = [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].



If [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] is in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] then [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] [[ZooRefs#BFL91|[BFL91] ]].



Problems complete for [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] under many-one reductions have measure 0 in [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#May94|[May94] ]], [[ZooRefs#JL95|[JL95] ]].



There exist oracles relative to which



[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] = [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] [Hel84a], [Hel84b], [[ZooRefs#Kur85|[Kur85] ]], [[ZooRefs#Hel86|[Hel86] ]],

[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] but still [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Dek76|[Dek76] ]],

[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] does not equal [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#Dek76|[Dek76] ]].



[[ZooRefs#BT04|[BT04] ]] show the following rather striking result: let A be many-one complete for [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]], and let S be any set in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] of subexponential density.  Then A-S is Turing-complete for [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].



[[ZooRefs#SM03|[SM03] ]] show that if [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] has circuits of polynomial size, then [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] can be simulated in [[Class_MAPOLYLOG|$\text{MA}_\text{POLYLOG}\text{}$]] such that no deterministic polynomial-time adversary can generate a list of inputs for a [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] problem that includes one which fails to be simulated. As a result, [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] âŠ† [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] if [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] has circuits of polynomial size.



[[ZooRefs#SU05|[SU05] ]] show that [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] $\
ot\\subseteq$ [[Class_NP/poly|$\text{NP/poly}$]] implies [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] $\
ot\\subseteq$ P^||NP^/poly.



In descriptive complexity EXPTIME can be defined as SO(2^{n^{O(1)}}) which is also SO(LFP)



[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] = [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Hel84|[Hel84] ]],

[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] = [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] but still [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Dek76|[Dek76] ]],

[[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] does not equal [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#Dek76|[Dek76] ]].
