== Comments ==

[[Class_SO[LFP]|$\text{SO[LFP]}$]] is to [[Class_SO|$\text{SO}$]] what FO[LFP] is to [[Class_FO|$\text{FO}$]]. The LFP operator can now also take second-order variable as argument.



In Descriptive complexity we can see that 

[[Class_SO[LFP]|$\text{SO[LFP]}$]] is  equal to EXPTIME.
