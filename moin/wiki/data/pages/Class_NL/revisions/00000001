= NL - Nondeterministic Logarithmic-Space =

== Comments ==

Has the same relation to L as NP does to P.

In a breakthrough result, was shown to equal coNL [Imm88] [Sze87].  (Though contrast to mNL.)

Is contained in LOGCFL [Sud78], as well as NC^2^.

Is contained in UL/poly [RA00].

Deciding whether a bipartite graph has a perfect matching is hard for NL [KUW86].

NL can be defined in a logical formalism as SO(krom) and also as FO(tc), reachability in directed graph is NL-Complete under FO-reduction.
