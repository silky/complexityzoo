[[ZooRefs#Fag74|[Fag74] ]] showed that [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is precisely the class of decision problems reducible to a graph-theoretic property expressible in second-order existential logic.



Then [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]] is the class of decision problems reducible to a graph-theoretic predicate with only universal quantifiers over vertices, no existential quantifiers.  As an example, k-SAT (CNF satisfiability with at most k literals per clause, for k a constant) is in [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]].  But general SAT is not in [[Class_SNP|$\text{SNP}$]], basically because we're not allowed to say, "There exists a literal in this clause that satisfies the clause."

There exists a relation P(u,v) on vertices of G, such that P(u,u) is false, and for all distinct u,v either P(u,v) or P(v,u), and P(u,v) and P(v,w) implies P(u,w), and if P(u,w) and there does not exist a v for which P(u,v) and P(v,w), then there is an edge from u to w.
