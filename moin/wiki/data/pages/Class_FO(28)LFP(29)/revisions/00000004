{{{#!description

FO(LFP) is the set of boolean queries definable with first-order fixed-point formulae where the partial fixed point is limited to be monotone, which means that if the second order variable is $P$, then $P_i(x)$ always implies $P_{i+1}(x)$.}}}

We can obtain the monotony by restricting the formula $\phi$ to have only positive occurrences of $P$ (i.e. there is an even number of negations before every occurrence of $P$). We can also describe LFP($\phi_{P,x}$) as syntactic sugar of PFP($\psi_{P,x}$) where $\psi(P,x)=\phi(P,x)\vee P(x)$.



Thanks to monotonicity we only add and never remove vectors to the truth table of $P$, and since there is only $n^k$ possible vectors we always find a fixed point before $n^k$ iterations. Hence it was shown in [[ZooRefs#Imm82|[Imm82] ]] that FO(LFP)=P. This definition is equivalent to FO(n^{O(1)}).
