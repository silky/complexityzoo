The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that the answer is 'yes' if and only if exactly one computation path accepts.



In contrast to [[Class_UP|$\text{UP}$]], a machine can legally have more than one accepting path - that just means that the corresponding input is not in the language.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BG82|[BG82] ]].



Contains [[Class_coNP|$\text{coNP}$]].
