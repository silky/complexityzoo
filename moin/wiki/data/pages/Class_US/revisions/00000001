The all-American counting class.

The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that the answer is 'yes' if and only if exactly one computation path accepts.

In contrast to UP, a machine can legally have more than one accepting path - that just means that the corresponding input is not in the language.

Defined in [BG82].

Contains coNP.
