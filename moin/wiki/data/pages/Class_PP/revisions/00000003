If the answer is 'yes' then at least 1/2 of computation paths accept.

If the answer is 'no' then less than 1/2 of computation paths accept.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Gil77|[Gil77] ]].



[[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] is closed under union and intersection [[ZooRefs#BRS91|[BRS91] ]] (this was an open problem for 14 years).



Contains [[Class_PNP[log]|$\text{P}^\text{NP[log]}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#BHW89|[BHW89] ]].



Equals PP^BPP^ [KST+89b] as well as [[Class_PostBQP|$\text{PostBQP}$]] [Aar05b].



However, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] does not contain [[Class_Δ2P|$\text{Δ}_\text{2}\text{P}$]] [[ZooRefs#Bei94|[Bei94] ]].



[[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] is in [[Class_PPP|$\text{P}^\text{PP}\text{}$]] [[ZooRefs#Tod89|[Tod89] ]].



[[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] is low for [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]]; i.e. PP^BQP^ = [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] [[ZooRefs#FR98|[FR98] ]].



For a random oracle A, [[Class_PPA|$\text{PP}^\text{A}\text{}$]] is strictly contained in PSPACE^A^ with probability 1 [[ZooRefs#ABF+94|[ABF+94] ]].



For any fixed k, there exists a language in [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] that does not have circuits of size n^k^ [Vin04b].  Indeed, there exists a language in [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] that does not even have quantum circuits of size n^k^ with quantum advice [[ZooRefs#Aar06|[Aar06] ]].



By contrast, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] has linear-size circuits [[ZooRefs#Aar06|[Aar06] ]].



[[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] can be generalized to the counting hierarchy [[Class_CH|$\text{CH}$]].
