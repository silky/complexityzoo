== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of pairs (A,B), where A and B are [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] problems whose sets of "yes" instances are nonempty and disjoint.}}}

== Comments ==



If there exists an optimal propositional proof system, then [[Class_DisNP|$\text{DisNP}$]] has a complete pair [[ZooRefs#Raz94|[Raz94] ]].  On the other hand, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_DisNP|$\text{DisNP}$]] does not have a complete pair [[ZooRefs#GSS+03|[GSS+03] ]].



If [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_UP|$\text{UP}$]], then [[Class_DisNP|$\text{DisNP}$]] contains pairs not separated by any set in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] [[ZooRefs#GS88|[GS88] ]].  On the other hand, there exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] but still [[Class_DisNP|$\text{DisNP}$]] does not contain any P-inseparable pairs [[ZooRefs#HS92|[HS92] ]].
