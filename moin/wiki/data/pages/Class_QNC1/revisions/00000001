== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_QNC1|$\text{QNC1}$]], but for the exact rather than bounded-error case.



In contrast to [[Class_NC1|$\text{NC1}$]], it is not clear how to simulate [[Class_QNC1|$\text{QNC1}$]] on a quantum computer in which one qubit is initialized to a pure state, and the remaining qubits are in the maximally mixed state [[ZooRefs#ASV00|[ASV00] ]].
