= SF,,k,, - Width-k Bottleneck Turing Machines =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a k-bottleneck Turing machine. This is a machine that, after a polynomial amount of time, erases everything on the tape except for a single k-valued "safe-storage".  There's also a counter recording the number of erasings, which is in effect a non-deterministic witness.  For example, SF,,2,, contains both ⊕P and NP by using the counter as a witness.

Defined in [CF91], where it was also shown that SF,,5,, = PSPACE.

The complexity of SF,,2,,, SF,,3,,, and SF,,4,, was studied in [Ogi94] and [Her97].  The following result of those authors is among the caged beasts of the Complexity Zoo:

SF,,4,, is contained in BP ⊕P^Mod_3P ^ ⊕P ^ Mod_3P ^ ⊕P^

(Here the BP operator means that one makes the class into a bounded-error probabilistic class, the same way one makes P into BPP and NP into AM.)
