== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable in polynomial space using at most a polynomial number of queries to the oracle.}}}

== Complete Problem ==

{{{#!complete_problem

}}}

== Comments ==



Thus, [[Class_PQUERY|$\text{PQUERY}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]], but PQUERY^A^ does not equal PSPACE^A^ for some oracles A.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Kur83|[Kur83] ]], where it was actually put forward as a serious argument (!!) against believing relativization results.
