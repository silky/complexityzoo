The class of decision problems solvable in polynomial space using at most a polynomial number of queries to the oracle.

Thus, PQUERY = PSPACE, but PQUERY^A^ does not equal PSPACE^A^ for some oracles A.

Defined in [Kur83], where it was actually put forward as a serious argument (!!) against believing relativization results.
