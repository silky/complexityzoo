== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of problems solvable by a semantic [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine with O(log n) advice bits that depend only on the input length n.  If the advice is good, the output must be correct with probability at least 2/3.  If it is bad, the machine must provide some answer with probability at least 2/3.  See the discussion for [[Class_BQP/poly|$\text{BQP/poly}$]].}}}
