Same as [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]], except that now the two distributions are merely required to be computationally indistinguishable by any [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] algorithm; they don't have to be statistically close.  (The "two distributions" are (1) the distribution over the verifier's view of their interaction with the prover, conditioned on the verifier's random coins, and (2) the distribution over views that the verifier can simulate without the prover's help.)}}}

Unlike [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]], it is not known if [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] is closed under complement.  [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] is now known to share other properties with [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]]: the verifier may as well be honest and may as well show their coins, and [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] is closed under unions [[ZooRefs#Vad06|[Vad06] ]].  (Previously, these properties were only established in the presence of one-way functions [[ZooRefs#GMW91|[GMW91] ]].)



Assuming the existence of one-way functions, [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] contains [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#GMW91|[GMW91] ]], and actually equals IP=PSPACE [[ZooRefs#BGG+90|[BGG+90] ]].  However, none of these implications of one-way functions relativize (Impagliazzo, unpublished).



On the other hand, if one-way functions do not exist then [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]] = [[Class_AVBPP|$\text{AVBPP}$]] [[ZooRefs#OW93|[OW93] ]].
