== Comments ==

Defined by [[ZooRefs#BFS86|[BFS86] ]], [[Class_UPPcc|$\text{UPPcc}$]] is one of two communication complexity analogues of [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]].

[[Class_UPPcc|$\text{UPPcc}$]] is the class of all languages defined by functions  which are computable by polylogarithmic protocols that accept with probability strictly greater than 1/2 when  and accept with probably strictly less than 1/2 otherwise. No accounting is made for how many random bits are consulted during the protocol.
