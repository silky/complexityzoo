== Comments ==

Defined by [BFS86], UPP^cc^ is one of two communication complexity analogues of PP.
UPP^cc^ is the class of all languages defined by functions  which are computable by polylogarithmic protocols that accept with probability strictly greater than 1/2 when  and accept with probably strictly less than 1/2 otherwise. No accounting is made for how many random bits are consulted during the protocol.
