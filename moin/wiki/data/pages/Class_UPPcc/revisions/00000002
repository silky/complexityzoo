== Comments ==

[[Class_UPPcc|$\text{UPP}^\text{cc}\text{}$]] is the class of all languages defined by functions $f : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ which are computable by polylogarithmic protocols that accept with probability strictly greater than 1/2 when $f(x,y) = 1$ and accept with probably strictly less than 1/2 otherwise. No accounting is made for how many random bits are consulted during the protocol.
