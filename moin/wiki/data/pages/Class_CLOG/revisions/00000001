Roughly, the class of continuous problems solvable by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with convergence time logarithmic in the size of the input.  The vector field of the ODE is specified by an NC^1^ formula, with n parameters that represent the input.  The point to which the ODE converges (assuming it does) is the output.

Defined in [BSF02], which should be consulted for more details.

[BSF02] show that finding the maximum of n integers is in CLOG.  Thus, CLOG is best thought of as the continuous-time analog of NC^1^, not of DTIME(log n).
