== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]], but with O(f(n))-time instead of polynomial-time.



For any constructible superpolynomial f, [[Class_ZPTIME(f(n))|$\text{ZPTIME(f(n))}$]] with [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] oracle is not contained in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] [[ZooRefs#KW98|[KW98] ]].
