The class of decision problems solvable by a BQP machine with oracle access to a dynamical simulator. When given a polynomial-size quantum circuit, the simulator returns a sample from the distribution over "classical histories" induced by the circuit. The simulator can adversarially choose any history distribution that satisfies the axioms of "symmetry" and "locality" -- so that the DQP algorithm has to work for any distribution satisfying these axioms.

See [Aar05] for a full definition.

There it is also shown that SZK is contained in DQP.

Contains BQP, and is contained in EXP [Aar05].

There exists an oracle relative to which DQP does not contain NP [Aar05].
