= DQP - Dynamical Quantum Polynomial-Time =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] machine with oracle access to a dynamical simulator. When given a polynomial-size quantum circuit, the simulator returns a sample from the distribution over "classical histories" induced by the circuit. The simulator can adversarially choose any history distribution that satisfies the axioms of "symmetry" and "locality" -- so that the [[Class_DQP|$\text{DQP}$]] algorithm has to work for any distribution satisfying these axioms.



See [[ZooRefs#Aar05|[Aar05] ]] for a full definition.



There it is also shown that [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]] is contained in [[Class_DQP|$\text{DQP}$]].



Contains [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]], and is contained in [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Aar05|[Aar05] ]].



There exists an oracle relative to which [[Class_DQP|$\text{DQP}$]] does not contain [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] [[ZooRefs#Aar05|[Aar05] ]].
