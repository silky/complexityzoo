= SBQP - Small Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that accepts with probability at least 2^−p(n)^ if the answer is "yes", and with probability at most 2^−p(n)−1^ if the answer is "no", for some polynomial p.



Defined by Kuperberg in [[ZooRefs#Kup09|[Kup09] ]], where he showed that [[Class_SBQP|$\text{SBQP}$]] = [[Class_A0PP|$\text{A0PP}$]].
