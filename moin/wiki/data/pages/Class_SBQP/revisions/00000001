= SBQP - Small Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time quantum algorithm that accepts with probability at least 2^−p(n)^ if the answer is "yes", and with probability at most 2^−p(n)−1^ if the answer is "no", for some polynomial p.

Defined by Kuperberg in [Kup09], where he showed that SBQP = A,,0,,PP.
