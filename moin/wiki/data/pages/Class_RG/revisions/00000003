{{{#!description

The class of problems solvable by a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier who can exchange a polynomial number of messages with two competing, computationally-unbounded provers -- one trying to convince the verifier that the answer is "yes," the other that the answer is "no."  Note that the verifier can hide information from the provers.  Public-coin [[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]] amounts to [[Class_SAPTIME|$\text{SAPTIME}$]], which equals [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#Pap83|[Pap83] ]].}}}

== Comments ==



[[Class_RG|$\text{RG}$]] is in [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]] relative to any oracle [[ZooRefs#KM92|[KM92] ]]; they are equal, unrelativized [FK97b].
