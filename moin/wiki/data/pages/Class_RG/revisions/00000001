= RG - Refereed Games =

== Comments ==

The class of problems solvable by a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier who can exchange a polynomial number of messages with two competing, computationally-unbounded provers -- one trying to convince the verifier that the answer is "yes," the other that the answer is "no."  Note that the verifier can hide information from the provers.  Public-coin RG amounts to SAPTIME, which equals PSPACE [Pap83].

RG is in EXP relative to any oracle [KM92]; they are equal, unrelativized [FK97b].

See also PCD, GPCD.

Contains RG[1], and is contained in QRG.
