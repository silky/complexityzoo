== Comments ==

Nondeterministic exponential time (i.e. NTIME(2^p(n)^) for p a polynomial).

Equals MIP [BFL91] (but not relative to all oracles).

NEXP is in MIP* [IV12].

NEXP is in P/poly if and only if NEXP = MA [IKW01].

[KI02] show the following:

If P = RP, then NEXP is not computable by polynomial-size arithmetic circuits.
If P = BPP and if checking whether a Boolean circuit computes a function that is close to a low-degree polynomial over a finite field is in P, then NEXP is not in P/poly.
If NEXP is in P/poly, then matrix permanent is NEXP-complete.

Does not equal NP [SFM78].

Does not equal EXP if and only if there is a sparse set in NP that is not in P.

There exists an oracle relative to which EXP = NEXP but still P does not equal NP [Dek76].

The theory of reals with addition (see EXPSPACE) is hard for NEXP [FR74].
