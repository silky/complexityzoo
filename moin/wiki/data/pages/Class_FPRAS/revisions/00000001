= FPRAS - Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme =

== Comments ==

The subclass of #P counting problems whose answer, y, is approximable in the following sense.  There exists a randomized algorithm that, with probability at least 1-δ, approximates y to within an ε multiplicative factor in time polynomial in n (the input size), 1/ε, and log(1/δ).

The permanent of a nonnegative matrix is in FPRAS [JSV01].
