== Description ==

{{{#!description

The subclass of [[Class_SharpP|$\text{#P}$]] counting problems whose answer, y, is approximable in the following sense.  There exists a randomized algorithm that, with probability at least 1-δ, approximates y to within an ε multiplicative factor in time polynomial in n (the input size), 1/ε, and log(1/δ).}}}
