== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of function problems, f:{0,1}^n^->{0,1}^m^, such that f(x) is computable in time polynomial in n and m.  Allows us to discuss whether a function is "efficiently computable" or not, even if the output is too long to write down in polynomial time.}}}
