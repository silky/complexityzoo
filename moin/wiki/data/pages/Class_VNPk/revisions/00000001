= VNP,,k,, - Valiant NP Over Field k =

== Comments ==

A superclass of VP,,k,, in Valiant's algebraic complexity theory, but not quite the analogue of NP.

A problem is in VNP,,k,, if there exists a polynomial p with the following properties:

p is computable in VP,,k,,; that is, by a polynomial-size straight-line program.
The inputs to p are constants c,,1,,,...,c,,m,,,e,,1,,,...,e,,h,, and indeterminates X,,1,,,...,X,,n,, over the base field k.
When p is summed over all 2^h^ possible assignments of {0,1} to each of e,,1,,,...,e,,h,,, the result is some specified polynomial q.

Originated in [Val79b].

If the field k has characteristic greater than 2, then the permanent of an n-by-n matrix of indeterminates is VNP,,k,,-complete under a type of reduction called p-projections ([Val79b]; see also [Bur00]).

A central conjecture is that for all k, VP,,k,, is not equal to VNP,,k,,.  Bürgisser [Bur00] shows that if this were false then:

If k is finite, NC^2^/poly = P/poly = NP/poly = PH/poly.
If k has characteristic 0, then assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), NC^3^/poly = P/poly = NP/poly = PH/poly, and #P/poly = FP/poly.

In both cases, PH collapses to Σ,,2,,P.
