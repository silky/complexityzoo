= VNP,,k,, - Valiant NP Over Field k =

== Comments ==

A superclass of [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]] in Valiant's algebraic complexity theory, but not quite the analogue of [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].



A problem is in [[Class_VNPk|$\text{VNPk}$]] if there exists a polynomial p with the following properties:



p is computable in [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]]; that is, by a polynomial-size straight-line program.

The inputs to p are constants c,,1,,,...,c,,m,,,e,,1,,,...,e,,h,, and indeterminates X,,1,,,...,X,,n,, over the base field k.

When p is summed over all 2^h^ possible assignments of {0,1} to each of e,,1,,,...,e,,h,,, the result is some specified polynomial q.



Originated in [Val79b].



If the field k has characteristic greater than 2, then the permanent of an n-by-n matrix of indeterminates is VNP,,k,,-complete under a type of reduction called p-projections ([Val79b]; see also [[ZooRefs#Bur00|[Bur00] ]]).



A central conjecture is that for all k, [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]] is not equal to [[Class_VNPk|$\text{VNPk}$]].  Bürgisser [[ZooRefs#Bur00|[Bur00] ]] shows that if this were false then:



If k is finite, NC^2^/poly = [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] = [[Class_NP/poly|$\text{NP/poly}$]] = PH/poly.

If k has characteristic 0, then assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), NC^3^/poly = [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] = [[Class_NP/poly|$\text{NP/poly}$]] = PH/poly, and #P/poly = FP/poly.



In both cases, [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] collapses to [[Class_Σ2P|$\text{Σ2P}$]].
