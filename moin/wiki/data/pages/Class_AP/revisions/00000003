== Description ==

{{{#!description

An alternating Turing machine is a nondeterministic machine with two kinds of states, AND states and OR states.  It accepts if and only if the tree of all computation paths, considered as an AND-OR tree, evaluates to 1.  (Here 'Accept' corresponds to 1 and 'Reject' to 0.)}}}

Then [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] is the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by an alternating Turing machine.



[[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] = [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] [[ZooRefs#CKS81|[CKS81] ]].



The abbreviation [[Class_AP|$\text{AP}$]] is also used for Approximable in Polynomial Time, see [[Class_AxP|$\text{AxP}$]].
