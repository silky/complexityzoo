= ZQP - Zero-Error Extension Of EQP =

== Comments ==

The class of questions that can be answered by a QTM that answers yes, no, or "maybe".  If the correct answer is yes, then P[no] = 0, and vice-versa; and the probability of maybe is at most 1/2.  Since some of the probabilities have to vanish, ZQP has the same technical caveats as EQP.

Defined independently in [BW03] and in [Nis02].

Contains EQP and ZBQP and is contained in BQP.  Equals RQP âˆ© coRQP.  There is an oracle such that ZQP^ZQP^ is larger than ZQP [BW03]; c.f. with ZBQP.
