The class of decision problems solvable by an NL machine such that

The number of accepting paths on input x is f(x), and
The answer is 'yes' if and only if R(x,f(x))=1, where R is some predicate computable in L.

Defined in [BDH+92], where it was also shown that LogFew is contained in Mod,,k,,L for all k>1.
