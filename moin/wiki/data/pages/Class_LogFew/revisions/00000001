The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NL|$\text{NL}$]] machine such that



The number of accepting paths on input x is f(x), and

The answer is 'yes' if and only if R(x,f(x))=1, where [[Class_R|$\text{R}$]] is some predicate computable in [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BDH+92|[BDH+92] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_LogFew|$\text{LogFew}$]] is contained in [[Class_ModkL|$\text{ModkL}$]] for all k>1.
