{{{#!description

The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by a public-coin quantum [[Class_AM|$\text{AM}$]] protocol, as follows.  Arthur generates a uniformly random (classical) string and sends it to Merlin.  Merlin responds with a polynomial-size quantum certificate, on which Arthur can perform any [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] operation.  The completeness and soundness requirements are the same as for [[Class_AM|$\text{AM}$]].}}}

Defined by Marriott and Watrous [[ZooRefs#MW05|[MW05] ]].



Contains [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] and is contained in [[Class_QIP[2]|$\text{QIP[2]}$]] and BPâ€¢PP (and therefore [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]]).
