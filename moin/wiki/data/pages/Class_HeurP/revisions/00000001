The class of distributional problems solvable by a [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] machine. Defined in [[ZooRefs#Imp95|[Imp95] ]], though he calls the class HP.



Alternately, [[ZooRefs#BT06|[BT06] ]] define [[Class_HeurP|$\text{HeurP}$]] as being the set of tuples , where  is a language and  is a distribution of problem instances, such that there exists an algorithm  satisfying two properties:



For every , for every  in the support of , and for every ,  runs in time bounded by .

 For every ,  is a heuristic algorithm for  whose error probability is bounded by .
