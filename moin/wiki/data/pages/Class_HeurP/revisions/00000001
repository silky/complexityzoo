== Comments ==

The class of distributional problems solvable by a P machine. Defined in [Imp95], though he calls the class HP.

Alternately, [BT06] define HeurP as being the set of tuples , where  is a language and  is a distribution of problem instances, such that there exists an algorithm  satisfying two properties:

For every , for every  in the support of , and for every ,  runs in time bounded by .
 For every ,  is a heuristic algorithm for  whose error probability is bounded by .
