== Comments ==



Of great relevance to DTIME is the Time Hierarchy Theorem: For any constructible function $f(n)$ greater than $n$, DTIME($f(n)$) is strictly contained in DTIME($f(n) \log(f(n)) \log\log(f(n))$) [[ZooRefs#HS65|[HS65] ]]. As a corollary, [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] âŠ‚ [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].



For any space constructible $f(n)$, DTIME($f(n)$) is strictly contained in DSPACE($f(n)$) [[ZooRefs#HPV77|[HPV77] ]].



Also, DTIME($n$) is strictly contained in NTIME(n) [[ZooRefs#PPS+83|[PPS+83] ]] (this result does not work for arbitrary $f(n)$).



For any constructible superpolynomial $f(n)$, DTIME($f(n)$) with [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] oracle is not in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] (see [[ZooRefs#All96|[All96] ]]).
