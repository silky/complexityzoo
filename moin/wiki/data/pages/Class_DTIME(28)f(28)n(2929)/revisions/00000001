The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in time . Note that some authors choose to call this class TIME.



Of great relevance to DTIME is the Time Hierarchy Theorem: For any constructible function  greater than , DTIME() is strictly contained in DTIME() [[ZooRefs#HS65|[HS65] ]]. As a corollary, [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] âŠ‚ [[Class_EXP|$\text{EXP}$]].



For any space constructible , DTIME() is strictly contained in DSPACE() [[ZooRefs#HPV77|[HPV77] ]].



Also, DTIME() is strictly contained in NTIME() [[ZooRefs#PPS+83|[PPS+83] ]] (this result does not work for arbitrary ).



For any constructible superpolynomial , DTIME() with [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] oracle is not in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] (see [[ZooRefs#All96|[All96] ]]).



The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in time O(f(n)).



The Time Hierarchy Theorem: For constructible f(n) greater than n, [[Class_DTIME(f(n))|$\text{DTIME(f(n))}$]] is strictly contained in DTIME(f(n) log(f(n)) loglog(f(n))) [[ZooRefs#HS65|[HS65] ]].



For any space constructible f(n), [[Class_DTIME(f(n))|$\text{DTIME(f(n))}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_DSPACE(f(n))|$\text{DSPACE(f(n))}$]] [[ZooRefs#HPV77|[HPV77] ]].



Also, DTIME(n) is strictly contained in NTIME(n) [[ZooRefs#PPS+83|[PPS+83] ]] (this result does not work for arbitrary f(n)).



For any constructible superpolynomial f(n), [[Class_DTIME(f(n))|$\text{DTIME(f(n))}$]] with [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] oracle is not in [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] (see [[ZooRefs#All96|[All96] ]]).
