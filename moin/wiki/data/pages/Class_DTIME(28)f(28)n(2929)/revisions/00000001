The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in time . Note that some authors choose to call this class TIME.

Of great relevance to DTIME is the Time Hierarchy Theorem: For any constructible function  greater than , DTIME() is strictly contained in DTIME() [HS65]. As a corollary, P âŠ‚ EXP.

For any space constructible , DTIME() is strictly contained in DSPACE() [HPV77].

Also, DTIME() is strictly contained in NTIME() [PPS+83] (this result does not work for arbitrary ).

For any constructible superpolynomial , DTIME() with PP oracle is not in P/poly (see [All96]).

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in time O(f(n)).

The Time Hierarchy Theorem: For constructible f(n) greater than n, DTIME(f(n)) is strictly contained in DTIME(f(n) log(f(n)) loglog(f(n))) [HS65].

For any space constructible f(n), DTIME(f(n)) is strictly contained in DSPACE(f(n)) [HPV77].

Also, DTIME(n) is strictly contained in NTIME(n) [PPS+83] (this result does not work for arbitrary f(n)).

For any constructible superpolynomial f(n), DTIME(f(n)) with PP oracle is not in P/poly (see [All96]).
