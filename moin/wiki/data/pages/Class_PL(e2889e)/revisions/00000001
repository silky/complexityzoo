The class of Boolean functions f:{-1,1}^n^->{-1,1} such that the maximum of |α|^-1^, over all Fourier coefficients α of f, is upper-bounded by a polynomial in n.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BS90|[BS90] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_PL∞|$\text{PL∞}$]] contains [[Class_PT1|$\text{PT1}$]] (and this inclusion is strict).
