= NQP - Nondeterministic Quantum Polynomial-Time =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a QTM in polynomial time such that a particular '|Accept>' state has nonzero amplitude at the end of the computation, if and only if the answer is 'yes.'  Since it has an exact amplitude condition, NQP has the same technical caveats as EQP.  Or it would, except that it turns out to equal coC,,=,,P [FGH+98].

Defined in [ADH97].

Contrast with QMA.
