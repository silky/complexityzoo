== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a QTM in polynomial time such that a particular '|Accept>' state has nonzero amplitude at the end of the computation, if and only if the answer is 'yes.'  Since it has an exact amplitude condition, [[Class_NQP|$\text{NQP}$]] has the same technical caveats as [[Class_EQP|$\text{EQP}$]].  Or it would, except that it turns out to equal [[Class_coC=P|$\text{coC}_\text{=}\text{P}$]] [[ZooRefs#FGH+98|[FGH+98] ]].}}}
