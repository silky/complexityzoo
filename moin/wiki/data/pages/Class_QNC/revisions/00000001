The class of decision problems solvable by polylogarithmic-depth quantum circuits with bounded probability of error.  (A uniformity condition may also be imposed.)



Has the same relation to [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]] as [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].



[[ZooRefs#CW00|[CW00] ]] showed that factoring is in [[Class_ZPP|$\text{ZPP}$]] with a [[Class_QNC|$\text{QNC}$]] oracle.



Is incomparable with [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] as far as anyone knows.
