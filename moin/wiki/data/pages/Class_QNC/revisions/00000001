


= QNC - Quantum NC =

The class of decision problems solvable by polylogarithmic-depth quantum circuits with bounded probability of error.  (A uniformity condition may also be imposed.)

Has the same relation to NC as BQP does to P.

[CW00] showed that factoring is in ZPP with a QNC oracle.

Is incomparable with BPP as far as anyone knows.
