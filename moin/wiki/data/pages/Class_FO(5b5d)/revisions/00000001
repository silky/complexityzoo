A quantifier block is a list  where the s are quantifier free FO-formulae and each s is either  or .
If  is a quantifier block then  is the block consisting of  iterated copies of . 
Note that there are  quantifiers in the list, but only k variables; each variable is used  times.

FO[] consists of the FO-formulae with quantifier blocks that are iterated  times.

In Descriptive complexity we can see that :

FO[] is equal to fo-uniform AC^i^, and in fact FO[] is fo-uniform AC of depth 
FO[] is equal to NC
FO[] is equal to P and FO(LFP)
FO[] is equal to PSPACE and FO(PFP)
