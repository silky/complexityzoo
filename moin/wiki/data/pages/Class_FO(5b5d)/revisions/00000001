Let  be a function from integers to integers.

A quantifier block is a list  where the s are quantifier free FO-formulae and each s is either  or .

If  is a quantifier block then  is the block consisting of  iterated copies of . 

Note that there are  quantifiers in the list, but only k variables; each variable is used  times.



[[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] consists of the FO-formulae with quantifier blocks that are iterated  times.



In Descriptive complexity we can see that :



[[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] is equal to fo-uniform AC^i^, and in fact [[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] is fo-uniform [[Class_AC|$\text{AC}$]] of depth 

[[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] is equal to [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]]

[[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] is equal to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] and [[Class_FO(LFP)|$\text{FO(LFP)}$]]

[[Class_FO[]|$\text{FO[]}$]] is equal to [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]] and [[Class_FO(PFP)|$\text{FO(PFP)}$]]
