= RevSPACE(f(n)) - Reversible f(n)-Space =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable in space O(f(n)) by a reversible Turing machine (a deterministic Turing machine for which every configuration has at most one immediate predecessor).



Was shown to equal [[Class_DSPACE(f(n))|$\text{DSPACE(f(n))}$]] [[ZooRefs#LMT97|[LMT97] ]].
