The class of optimization problems such that, given an instance of length n, we can find a solution within a factor 1+ε of the optimum in time f(ε)p(n), where p is a polynomial and f is arbitrary.

Contains FPTAS and is contained in PTAS.

Defined in [CT97], where the following was also shown:

If FPT = XP,,uniform,, then EPTAS = PTAS.
If EPTAS = PTAS then FPT = W[P].
If FPT is strictly contained in W[1], then there is a natural problem that is in PTAS but not in EPTAS.  (See [CT97] for the statement of the problem, since it's not that natural.)
