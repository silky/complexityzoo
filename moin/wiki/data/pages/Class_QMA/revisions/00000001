The class of decision problems such that a "yes" answer can be verified by a 1-message quantum interactive proof.  That is, a BQP (i.e. quantum polynomial-time) verifier is given a quantum state (the "proof").  We require that

If the answer is "yes," then there exists a state such that verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3.
If the answer is "no," then for all states the verifier rejects with probability at least 2/3.

QMA = QIP(1).

Defined in [Wat00], where it is also shown that group non-membership is in QMA.

Based on this, [Wat00] gives an oracle relative to which MA is strictly contained in QMA.

Kitaev and Watrous (unpublished) showed QMA is contained in PP (see [MW05] for a proof).  Combining that result with [Ver92], one can obtain an oracle relative to which AM is not in QMA.

Kitaev ([KSV02], see also [AN02]) showed that the 5-Local Hamiltonians Problem is QMA-complete. Subsequently, Kempe and Regev [KR03] showed that even 3-Local Hamiltonians is QMA-complete.  A subsequent paper by Kempe, Kitaev, and Regev [KKR04], has hit rock bottom (assuming P does not equal QMA), by showing 2-local Hamiltonians QMA-complete.

Compare to NQP.

If QMA = PP then PP contains PH [Vya03].  This result uses the fact that QMA is contained in A,,0,,PP.

Approximating the ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is QMA-complete [AGK07].

Defined in [Wat00], where it is also shown that group non-membership is in QMA.  That is: let G be a group, whose elements are represented by polynomial-size strings.  We're given a "black box" that correctly multiplies and inverts elements of G.  Then given elements g and h,,1,,,...,h,,k,,, we can verify in QMA that g is not in the subgroup generated by h,,1,,,...,h,,k,,.

5-Local Hamiltonians.  Given an n-qubit Hilbert space, as well as a collection H,,1,,,...,H,,k,, of Hamiltonians (i.e. Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices), each of which acts on at most 5 qubits of the space.  Also given reals a,b such that b-a = Î˜(1/poly(n)).  Decide whether the smallest eigenvalue of H=H,,1,,+...+H,,k,, is less than a or greater than b, promised that one of these is the case.

Subsequently Kempe and Regev [KR03] showed that even 3-Local Hamiltonians is QMA-complete.  A subsequent paper by Kempe, Kitaev, and Regev [KKR04], has hit rock bottom (assuming P does not equal QMA), by showing 2-local Hamiltonians QMA-complete.
