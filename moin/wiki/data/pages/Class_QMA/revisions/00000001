The class of decision problems such that a "yes" answer can be verified by a 1-message quantum interactive proof.  That is, a [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]] (i.e. quantum polynomial-time) verifier is given a quantum state (the "proof").  We require that



If the answer is "yes," then there exists a state such that verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3.

If the answer is "no," then for all states the verifier rejects with probability at least 2/3.



[[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] = QIP(1).



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Wat00|[Wat00] ]], where it is also shown that group non-membership is in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].



Based on this, [[ZooRefs#Wat00|[Wat00] ]] gives an oracle relative to which [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] is strictly contained in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].



Kitaev and Watrous (unpublished) showed [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] is contained in [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] (see [[ZooRefs#MW05|[MW05] ]] for a proof).  Combining that result with [[ZooRefs#Ver92|[Ver92] ]], one can obtain an oracle relative to which [[Class_AM|$\text{AM}$]] is not in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].



Kitaev ([[ZooRefs#KSV02|[KSV02] ]], see also [[ZooRefs#AN02|[AN02] ]]) showed that the 5-Local Hamiltonians Problem is QMA-complete. Subsequently, Kempe and Regev [[ZooRefs#KR03|[KR03] ]] showed that even 3-Local Hamiltonians is QMA-complete.  A subsequent paper by Kempe, Kitaev, and Regev [[ZooRefs#KKR04|[KKR04] ]], has hit rock bottom (assuming [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal QMA), by showing 2-local Hamiltonians QMA-complete.



Compare to [[Class_NQP|$\text{NQP}$]].



If [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] = [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] then [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] contains [[Class_PH|$\text{PH}$]] [[ZooRefs#Vya03|[Vya03] ]].  This result uses the fact that [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] is contained in [[Class_A0PP|$\text{A0PP}$]].



Approximating the ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is QMA-complete [[ZooRefs#AGK07|[AGK07] ]].

Defined in [[ZooRefs#Wat00|[Wat00] ]], where it is also shown that group non-membership is in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].  That is: let G be a group, whose elements are represented by polynomial-size strings.  We're given a "black box" that correctly multiplies and inverts elements of G.  Then given elements g and h,,1,,,...,h,,k,,, we can verify in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] that g is not in the subgroup generated by h,,1,,,...,h,,k,,.

5-Local Hamiltonians.  Given an n-qubit Hilbert space, as well as a collection H,,1,,,...,H,,k,, of Hamiltonians (i.e. Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices), each of which acts on at most 5 qubits of the space.  Also given reals a,b such that b-a = Î˜(1/poly(n)).  Decide whether the smallest eigenvalue of H=H,,1,,+...+H,,k,, is less than a or greater than b, promised that one of these is the case.



Subsequently Kempe and Regev [[ZooRefs#KR03|[KR03] ]] showed that even 3-Local Hamiltonians is QMA-complete.  A subsequent paper by Kempe, Kitaev, and Regev [[ZooRefs#KKR04|[KKR04] ]], has hit rock bottom (assuming [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] does not equal QMA), by showing 2-local Hamiltonians QMA-complete.
