Defined in [[ZooRefs#BG03|[BG03] ]], where the following was also shown:



[[Class_NISZKh|$\text{NISZK}_\text{h}\text{}$]] contains [[Class_NISZK|$\text{NISZK}$]] and is contained in [[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]].

Graph Isomorphism is in [[Class_NISZKh|$\text{NISZK}_\text{h}\text{}$]].

The following problem is complete for [[Class_NISZKh|$\text{NISZK}_\text{h}\text{}$]]: Given two functions from {0,1}^n^ to {0,1}^n^ (specified by circuits), decide whether their ranges are almost equal or almost disjoint, given that one of these is the case.



The quantum lower bound for the set comparison problem in [[ZooRefs#Aar02|[Aar02] ]] implies an oracle relative to which [[Class_NISZKh|$\text{NISZK}_\text{h}\text{}$]] is not in [[Class_BQP|$\text{BQP}$]].
