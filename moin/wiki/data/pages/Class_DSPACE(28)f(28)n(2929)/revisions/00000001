== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in space O(f(n)).

The Space Hierarchy Theorem: For constructible f(n) greater than log
n, DSPACE(f(n)) is strictly contained in DSPACE(f(n) log(f(n))) [HLS65].

For space constructible f(n), strictly contains DTIME(f(n)) [HPV77].

DSPACE(n) does not equal NP (though we have no idea if one contains the other)!

See also: NSPACE(f(n)).
