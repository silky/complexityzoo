{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine in space O(f(n)).}}}

The Space Hierarchy Theorem: For constructible f(n) greater than log

n, DSPACE(f(n)) is strictly contained in DSPACE(f(n) log(f(n))) [[ZooRefs#HLS65|[HLS65] ]].



For space constructible f(n), strictly contains DTIME(f(n)) [[ZooRefs#HPV77|[HPV77] ]].



DSPACE(n) does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] (though we have no idea if one contains the other)!
