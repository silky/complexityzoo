By definition, a decision problem in NC^0^ can depend on only a constant number of bits of the input.  Thus, NC^0^ usually refers to functions computable by constant-depth, bounded-fanin circuits.

There is a family of permutations computable by a uniform family of NC^0^ circuits that is P-hard to invert [Has88].

Recently [AIK04] solved a longstanding open problem by showing that there exist pseudorandom generators and one-way functions in NC^0^, based on (for example) the hardness of factoring.  Specifically, in these generators every bit of the output depends on only 4 input bits.  Whether the dependence can be reduced to 3 bits under the same cryptographic assumptions is open, but [AIK04] have some partial results in this direction.  It is known that the dependence cannot be reduced to 2 bits.
