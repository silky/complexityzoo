We define a relation of order $o$ and arity $k$ to be a subset of $k$-tuple of relation of order $o-1$ and arity $k$. When $o=1$ it is by extension a first order variable. The quantification of formula in [[Class_HO|$\text{HO}$]] is over a given order (which is a straightforward extension of [[Class_SO|$\text{SO}$]] where we add quantification over constant (first-order variable) and relation (second-order variables). The atomic predicates now can be general application of relation of order $o$ and arity $k$ to $k$ relations of order $o-1$ and arity $a$ and  test of equality between two relations of the same order and arity.



$HO^o$ is the set of formulae with quantification up to order O. $\Sigma^i_j$(resp. $\Pi_j^i$) is defined as the set of formula in $HO^{i+1}$ beginning by an existantial (resp universal) quantifier followed by at most $j-1$ alternation of quantifiers.



This class was define in [[ZooRefs#HT06|[HT06] ]], and it was proved that $\Sigma^i_j=\exp_2^{i-1}(n^O(1))^{\Sigma^P_{j-1}}$ where $\Sigma^P_{j-1}$ is the $j$th level of the polynomial hierarchy.
