== Comments ==

Defined as RBQP ∩ coRBQP.  Equivalently, the class of problems in NP ∩ coNP such that both positive and negative witnesses are in FBQP.

For example, the language of square-free numbers is in ZBQP, because factoring is in FBQP and a factorization can be certified in ZPP (indeed in P, by [AKS02]).

Unlike EQP or ZQP, ZBQP would generalize ZPP in practice if quantum computers existed, in the sense that it provides proven answers.

Contains ZPP and is contained in RBQP and ZQP.  Also, ZBQP^ZBQP^ = ZBQP.  Defined here to clarify EQP and ZQP.
