= SBP - Small Bounded-Error Probability =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which the following holds.  There exists a #P function f and an FP function g such that, for all inputs x,

If the answer is "yes" then f(x) > g(x).
If the answer is "no" then f(x) < g(x)/2.

Defined in [BGM02], where the following was also shown:

SBP contains MA, WAPP, and ∃BPP.
SBP is contained in AM and BPP,,path,,.
There exists an oracle relative to which SBP is not contained in Σ,,2,,P.
SBP is closed under union.
