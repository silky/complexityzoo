Same as CLOG, except that the convergence time can be polynomial rather than logarithmic in the input size.

Defined in [BSF02] and [SF98].

Finding a maximum flow, which is P-complete, can be done in CP [BSF02].  Based on this the authors argue that "P is contained in CP," but this seems hard to formalize, since CP is not a complexity class in the usual sense.  They also conjecture that "CP is contained in P" (i.e. the class of ODE's they consider can be integrated efficiently on a standard Turing machine), but this is open.

Contained in CNP.
