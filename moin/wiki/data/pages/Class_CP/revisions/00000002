Defined in [[ZooRefs#BSF02|[BSF02] ]] and [[ZooRefs#SF98|[SF98] ]].



Finding a maximum flow, which is P-complete, can be done in [[Class_CP|$\text{CP}$]] [[ZooRefs#BSF02|[BSF02] ]].  Based on this the authors argue that "P is contained in CP," but this seems hard to formalize, since [[Class_CP|$\text{CP}$]] is not a complexity class in the usual sense.  They also conjecture that "CP is contained in P" (i.e. the class of ODE's they consider can be integrated efficiently on a standard Turing machine), but this is open.



Contained in [[Class_CNP|$\text{CNP}$]].
