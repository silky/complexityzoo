== Comments ==

Same as [[Class_NC|$\text{NC}$]], but with O(f(n)) nondeterministic gates. A nondeterministic gate has no inputs and a single output bit.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#Wol94|[Wol94] ]], where the author proves various inclusions, including but not limited to NNC(poly(n))=NP, NNC(log(n))=NC, and NNC(polylog)âŠ†DSPACE(polylog).
