= Pr,,H,,SPACE(f(n)) - Unbounded-Error Halting Probabilistic f(n)-Space =

== Comments ==

Has the same relation to [[Class_DSPACE(f(n))|$\text{DSPACE(f(n))}$]] as [[Class_PP|$\text{PP}$]] does to [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]].  The Turing machine has to halt on every input and every setting of the random tape.



Equals [[Class_PrSPACE(f(n))|$\text{PrSPACE(f(n))}$]] [[ZooRefs#Jun85|[Jun85] ]].
