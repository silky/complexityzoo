The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that for some polynomial-time computable (i.e. FP) function f,

If the answer is "no," then the difference between the number of accepting and rejecting paths is non-negative and at most 2^-poly(n)^f(x).
If the answer is "yes," then the difference is between (1-2^-poly(n)^)f(x) and f(x).
