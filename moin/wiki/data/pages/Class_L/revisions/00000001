The class of decision problems solvable by a Turing machine restricted to use an amount of memory logarithmic in the size of the input, n.  (The input itself is not counted as part of the memory.)

L is contained in P.  L contains NC^1^ [Bor77], and is contained in generalizations including NL, L/poly, SL, RL, ⊕L, and Mod,,k,,L.

Reingold [Rei04] showed that, remarkably, L = SL.  In other words, undirected graph connectivity is solvable in deterministic logarithmic space.

Immerman [Imm83] showed that L is the class FO(dtc) of first-order expressible queries with a deterministic transitive closure.

L queries are exactly the one that can be written in a syntactic restriction of  While languages.
