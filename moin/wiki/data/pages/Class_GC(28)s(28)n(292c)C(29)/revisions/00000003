guessing s(n) bits, then

verifying the answer in complexity class C.



For example, GC(p(n),P) = [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] where p is a polynomial.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#CC93|[CC93] ]].



Umans [[ZooRefs#Uma98|[Uma98] ]] has shown that given a DNF expression Φ, the Shortest Implicant problem is GC(log^2^n, coNP)-complete.



Umans [[ZooRefs#Uma98|[Uma98] ]] has shown that given a DNF expression Φ, the Shortest Implicant problem (is there a conjunction of at most k negated or non-negated literals that implies Φ?) is GC(log^2^n, coNP)-complete.
