= GC(s(n),C) - Guess and Check =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by

guessing s(n) bits, then
verifying the answer in complexity class C.

For example, GC(p(n),P) = NP where p is a polynomial.

Defined in [CC93].

Umans [Uma98] has shown that given a DNF expression Φ, the Shortest Implicant problem is GC(log^2^n, coNP)-complete.

Umans [Uma98] has shown that given a DNF expression Φ, the Shortest Implicant problem (is there a conjunction of at most k negated or non-negated literals that implies Φ?) is GC(log^2^n, coNP)-complete.
