{{{#!description

Roughly, the analogue of [[Class_SharpP|$\text{#P}$]] for parameterized complexity.  I.e. the class of parameterized counting problems that are fixed-parameter parsimonious reducible to the following problem:}}}

#WSAT: Given a Boolean formula, count the number of satisfying assignments of Hamming weight k (where k is the parameter).



Defined in [[ZooRefs#FG02|[FG02] ]], which should be consulted for the full definition.  [[ZooRefs#FG02|[FG02] ]] also showed that there exist #W[1]-complete problems whose corresponding decision problems are fixed-parameter tractable (i.e. in [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]]).
