The obvious generalization of [[Class_NPcc|$\text{NPcc}$]] and [[Class_coNPcc|$\text{coNPcc}$]] to a nondeterministic hierarchy.



It is unknown whether Σ,,2,,^cc^ equals Π,,2,,^cc^.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BFS86|[BFS86] ]], where it was also shown (among other things) that [[Class_BPPcc|$\text{BPPcc}$]] is contained in Σ,,2,,^cc^ ∩ Π,,2,,^cc^.
