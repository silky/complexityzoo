= QCMA - Quantum Classical MA =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by a quantum computer with access to a classical proof. Also known as the subclass of of QMA with classical witnesses.

Called MQA by Watrous [Wat09].

Contains MA, and is contained in QMA.

Given a black-box group G and a subgroup H, the problem of testing non-membership in H has polynomial QCMA query complexity [AK06].

See [AK06] for a "quantum oracle separation" between QCMA and QMA.  No classical oracle separation between QCMA and QMA is currently known.
