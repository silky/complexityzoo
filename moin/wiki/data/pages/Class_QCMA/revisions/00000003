== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by a quantum computer with access to a classical proof. Also known as the subclass of of [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] with classical witnesses.}}}

== Complete Problem ==

{{{#!complete_problem

}}}

== Comments ==



Called MQA by Watrous [[ZooRefs#Wat09|[Wat09] ]].



Contains [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]], and is contained in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].



Given a black-box group G and a subgroup H, the problem of testing non-membership in H has polynomial [[Class_QCMA|$\text{QCMA}$]] query complexity [[ZooRefs#AK06|[AK06] ]].



See [[ZooRefs#AK06|[AK06] ]] for a "quantum oracle separation" between [[Class_QCMA|$\text{QCMA}$]] and [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].  No classical oracle separation between [[Class_QCMA|$\text{QCMA}$]] and [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] is currently known.



The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by a quantum computer with access to a classical proof.
