The class of efficiently-solvable problems in Valiant's algebraic complexity theory.

More formally, the input consists of constants c,,1,,,...,c,,m,, and indeterminates X,,1,,,...,X,,n,, over a base field k (for instance, the complex numbers or Z,,2,,).  The desired output is a collection of polynomials over the X,,i,,'s.  The complexity is the minimum number of pairwise additions, subtractions, and multiplications needed by a straight-line program to produce these polynomials.  VP,,k,, is the class of problems whose complexity is polynomial in n.  (Hence, VP,,k,, is a nonuniform class, in contrast to P,,C,, and P,,R,,.)
