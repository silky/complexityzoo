== Comments ==

The class of efficiently-solvable problems in Valiant's algebraic complexity theory.



More formally, the input consists of constants c,,1,,,...,c,,m,, and indeterminates X,,1,,,...,X,,n,, over a base field k (for instance, the complex numbers or Z,,2,,).  The desired output is a collection of polynomials over the X,,i,,'s.  The complexity is the minimum number of pairwise additions, subtractions, and multiplications needed by a straight-line program to produce these polynomials.  [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]] is the class of problems whose complexity is polynomial in n.  (Hence, [[Class_VPk|$\text{VPk}$]] is a nonuniform class, in contrast to [[Class_PC|$\text{PC}$]] and P,,R,,.)



Originated in [Val79b]; see [[ZooRefs#Bur00|[Bur00] ]] for more information.



Contained in [[Class_VNPk|$\text{VNPk}$]] and [[Class_VQPk|$\text{VQPk}$]], and contains [[Class_VNCk|$\text{VNCk}$]].
