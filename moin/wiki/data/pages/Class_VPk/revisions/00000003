More formally, the input consists of constants c,,1,,,...,c,,m,, and indeterminates X,,1,,,...,X,,n,, over a base field k (for instance, the complex numbers or Z,,2,,).  The desired output is a collection of polynomials over the X,,i,,'s.  The complexity is the minimum number of pairwise additions, subtractions, and multiplications needed by a straight-line program to produce these polynomials.  [[Class_VPk|$\text{VP}_\text{k}\text{}$]] is the class of problems whose complexity is polynomial in n.  (Hence, [[Class_VPk|$\text{VP}_\text{k}\text{}$]] is a nonuniform class, in contrast to [[Class_PC|$\text{P}_\text{C}\text{}$]] and [[Class_PR|$\text{P}_\text{R}\text{}$]].)
