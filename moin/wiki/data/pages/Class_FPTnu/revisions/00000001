== Comments ==

Same as FPT except that the algorithm can vary with the parameter k (though its running time must always be O(p(|x|)), for a fixed polynomial p).

An alternate view is that a single algorithm can take a polynomial-length advice string, depending on k.

Defined in [DF99] (though they did not use our notation).
