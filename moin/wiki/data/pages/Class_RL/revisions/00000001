= RL - Randomized Logarithmic-Space =

== Comments ==

Has the same relation to L as RP does to P.  The randomized machine must halt with probability 1 on any input.  It must also run in polynomial time (since otherwise we would just get
NL).

Contains R,,H,,L.

Contained in SC [Nis92].

[RTV05] give strong evidence that RL = L.
