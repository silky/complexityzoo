Roughly, the class of decision problems for which the following holds.  For all polynomials p(n), there exist GapP functions f and g such that for all inputs x with n=|x|,

If the answer is "yes" then 1 > f(x)/g(1^n^) > 1-2^-p(n)^.
If the answer is "no" then 0 < f(x)/g(1^n^) < 2^-p(n)^.

Defined in [Li93], where the following was also shown:

APP is contained in PP, and indeed is low for PP.
APP is closed under intersection, union, and complement.

APP contains AWPP [Fen02].

The abbreviation APP is also used for Approximable in Probabilistic Polynomial Time, see AxPP.
