== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of promise problems solvable by an [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]] machine. I.e., the machine must accept with probability at least 1/2 for "yes" inputs, and with probability 0 for "no" inputs, but could have acceptance probability between 0 and 1/2 for inputs that do not satisfy the promise.}}}

Defined in [[ZooRefs#BF99|[BF99] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] is in RP^PromiseRP[1]^ (i.e. with a single oracle query to [[Class_PromiseRP|$\text{PromiseRP}$]]).



Contained in [[Class_PromiseBPP|$\text{PromiseBPP}$]].
