= ModP - ModkP With Arbitrary k =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by a [[Class_ModkP|$\text{ModkP}$]] machine where k can vary depending on the input.  The only requirement is that 0^k^ be computable in polynomial time.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KT96|[KT96] ]], where it was also shown that [[Class_ModP|$\text{ModP}$]] is contained in [[Class_AmpMP|$\text{AmpMP}$]].
