The class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are fixed-parameter reducible to the following:



Weighted 3SAT: Given a 3SAT formula, does it have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight k?



A fixed-parameter reduction is a Turing reduction that takes time at most f(k)p(|x|), where f is an arbitrary function and p is a polynomial.  Also, if the input is (x,k), then all Weighted 3SAT instances the algorithm queries about must have the form <x',k'> where k' is at most k.



Contains [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#DF99|[DF99] ]], where the following is also shown:



If [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]] = [[Class_W[1]|$\text{W[1]}$]] then [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] is contained in DTIME(2^o(n)^).



[[Class_W[1]|$\text{W[1]}$]] can be generalized to [[Class_W[t]|$\text{W[t]}$]].
