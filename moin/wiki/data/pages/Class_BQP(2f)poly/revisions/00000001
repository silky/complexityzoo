Is to BQP/mpoly as âˆƒBPP is to MA.  Namely, the BQP machine is required to give some answer with probability at least 2/3 even if the advice is bad.  Even though BQP/mpoly is a more natural class, BQP/poly follows the standard definition of advice as a class operator [KL82].

Contained in BQP/mpoly and contains BQP/log.
