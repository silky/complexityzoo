A quantum multi-prover interactive proof system is the same as a classical one, except that all messages and verifier computations are quantum.  As in [[Class_MIP|$\text{MIP}$]], there is no communication among the provers; however, the provers share unlimited prior entanglement.  The number of provers and number of rounds can both be polynomial in n.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KM02|[KM02] ]].



Shown to be equal to [[Class_MIP*|$\text{MIP*}$]] in [[ZooRefs#RUV12|[RUV12] ]].



[[Class_QMIP|$\text{QMIP}$]] contains [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] simply because [[Class_MIP*|$\text{MIP*}$]] contains [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] [[ZooRefs#IV12|[IV12] ]]. Since we know that [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] = [[Class_QMIPne|$\text{QMIP}_\text{ne}\text{}$]], this tells us that giving the provers unlimited prior entanglement does not make the class less powerful.



Fascinatingly, no relationship between [[Class_QMIP|$\text{QMIP}$]] and [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]] is known.  We don't know whether allowing the provers unlimited prior entanglement makes the class more powerful, less powerful, or both!
