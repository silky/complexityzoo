The quantum generalization of MIP, and the multi-prover generalization of QIP.

A quantum multi-prover interactive proof system is the same as a classical one, except that all messages and verifier computations are quantum.  As in MIP, there is no communication among the provers; however, the provers share unlimited prior entanglement.  The number of provers and number of rounds can both be polynomial in n.

Defined in [KM02].

Shown to be equal to MIP* in [RUV12].

QMIP contains NEXP simply because MIP* contains NEXP [IV12]. Since we know that NEXP = QMIP,,ne,,, this tells us that giving the provers unlimited prior entanglement does not make the class less powerful.

Fascinatingly, no relationship between QMIP and NEXP is known.  We don't know whether allowing the provers unlimited prior entanglement makes the class more powerful, less powerful, or both!
