Roughly, the analogue of #P for parameterized complexity.  I.e. the class of parameterized counting problems that are fixed-parameter parsimonious reducible to the following problem:

#WSAT: Given a Boolean formula, count the number of satisfying assignments of Hamming weight k (where k is the parameter).

Defined in [FG02], which should be consulted for the full definition.  [FG02] also showed that there exist #W[1]-complete problems whose corresponding decision problems are fixed-parameter tractable (i.e. in FPT).
