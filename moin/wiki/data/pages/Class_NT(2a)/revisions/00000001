Defined like NT, but with a more general ordering on inputs.  A problem L is in NT* if, first, there is a partially defined predecessor function pred(x) in FP that organizes the space of inputs into a forest.  The size of the lineage of each x must also be bounded by 2^poly(|x|)^.  Second, if L(x) is the Boolean answer to L on input x, then L(x)+L(pred(x)) is computable in polynomial time; or if pred(x) does not exist, L(x) is computable in polynomial time.

Defined in [GHJ+91].

Contains NT and is contained in ⊕P.  The inclusions are either both strict or both equalities (whence ⊕P = P as well).
