The class of problems for which a 1-1/poly(n) fraction of instances are solvable by a BPTIME(f(n)) machine. Thus, HeurBPTIME(f(n)) has the same relationship with BPTIME as HeurDTIME.

Thus HeurBPP is the union of HeurBPTIME(n^c^) over all c.

The class of problems for which a 1-1/poly(n) fraction of instances are solvable by a BPTIME(f(n)) machine.
