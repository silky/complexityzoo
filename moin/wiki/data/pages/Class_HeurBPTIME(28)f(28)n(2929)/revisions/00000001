== Comments ==

The class of problems for which a 1-1/poly(n) fraction of instances are solvable by a [[Class_BPTIME(f(n))|$\text{BPTIME(f(n))}$]] machine. Thus, [[Class_HeurBPTIME(f(n))|$\text{HeurBPTIME(f(n))}$]] has the same relationship with BPTIME as HeurDTIME.



Thus [[Class_HeurBPP|$\text{HeurBPP}$]] is the union of HeurBPTIME(n^c^) over all c.
