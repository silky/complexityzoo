= G[t] - Stratification of Fixed-Parameter Tractable Problems =

== Comments ==

(Basically) the class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are solvable by a parameterized family of circuits with unbounded fanin and depth t.  A uniformity condition may also be imposed.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#DF99|[DF99] ]], which should be consulted for the full definition.



Uniform G[P] (i.e. with no restriction on depth) is equal to [[Class_FPT|$\text{FPT}$]].
