Equals DSPACE((log n)^c^).



In contrast to [[Class_L|$\text{L}$]], which is contained in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], it is not known if [[Class_polyL|$\text{polyL}$]] is contained in [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] or vice versa.  On the other hand, we do know that [[Class_polyL|$\text{polyL}$]] does not equal [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]], since (for example) [[Class_polyL|$\text{polyL}$]] does not have complete problems under many-to-one logspace reductions.
