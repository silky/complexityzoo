The class of decision problems of the form (x,k) (k a parameter), that are fixed-parameter reducible to the following problem, for some constant h:

Weighted Circuit-SAT: Given a Boolean circuit C (with no restriction on depth), does C have a satisfying assignment of Hamming weight k?

See W[1] for the definition of fixed-parameter reducibility.
