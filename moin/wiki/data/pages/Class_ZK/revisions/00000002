== Description ==

{{{#!description

Often used as a shorthand for (computational zero-knowledge) [[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]], but may also be used as a general paradigm encomposing various classes ranging from perfect and statistical zero-knowledge ([[Class_SZK|$\text{SZK}$]]) to computational ones ([[Class_CZK|$\text{CZK}$]]), and also various forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems.}}}

== Comments ==



Zero-knowledge proofs were introduced in [[ZooRefs#GMR89|[GMR89] ]], and further studied in [[ZooRefs#GMW91|[GMW91] ]], which demonstrated the wide applicability of the concept.
