Often used as a shorthand for (computational zero-knowledge) CZK, but may also be used as a general paradigm encomposing various classes ranging from perfect and statistical zero-knowledge (SZK) to computational ones (CZK), and also various forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems.

Zero-knowledge proofs were introduced in [GMR89], and further studied in [GMW91], which demonstrated the wide applicability of the concept.
