The class of languages L in NP such that the union, over all x in L, of the set of valid witnesses for x equals L itself.

Defined in [HT03], where it was shown that the closure of SelfNP under polynomial-time many-one reductions is NP.

They also show that if SelfNP = NP, then E = NE; and that SAT is contained in SelfNP.
