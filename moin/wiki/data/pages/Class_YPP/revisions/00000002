The probabilistic analogue of [[Class_YP|$\text{YP}$]]; it is to [[Class_YP|$\text{YP}$]] what [[Class_MA|$\text{MA}$]] is to [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].  Formally, the class of decision problems for which there exists a syntactic [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] machine M such that:}}}

For all input sizes n, there exists a polynomial-size advice string a,,n,, such that for all inputs x of size n, M(x,a,,n,,) outputs the correct answer with probability at least 2/3.

For all inputs x and advice strings a, the probability that M(x,a) outputs the incorrect answer is at most 1/3.  In other words, the sum of the probabilities of the correct answer and "I don't know" is at least 2/3.



To amplify a [[Class_YPP|$\text{YPP}$]] machine, one can run it multiple times, then accept if a majority of runs accept, reject if a majority reject, and otherwise output "I don't know."
