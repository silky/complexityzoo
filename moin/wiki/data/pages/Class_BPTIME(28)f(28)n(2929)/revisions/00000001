Same as BPP, but with f(n)-time (for some constructible function f) rather than polynomial-time machines.

Defined in [Gil77].

BPTIME(n^log n^) does not equal BPTIME(2^n^ε^) for any ε>0 [KV88].  Proving a stronger time hierarchy theorem for BPTIME is a longstanding open problem; see [BH97] for details.

[Bar02] has shown the following:

If we allow a small number of advice bits (say log n), then there is a strict hierarchy: for every d at least 1, BPTIME(n^d^)/(log n) does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^)/(log n).
In the uniform setting, if BPP has complete problems then BPTIME(n^d^) does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^).
BPTIME(n) does not equal NP.

Subsequently, [FS04] managed to reduce the number of advice bits to only 1: BPTIME(n^d^)/1 does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^)/1.  They also proved a hierarchy theorem for HeurBPTIME.
