BPTIME(n^log n^) does not equal BPTIME(2^n^ε^) for any ε>0 [[ZooRefs#KV88|[KV88] ]].  Proving a stronger time hierarchy theorem for BPTIME is a longstanding open problem; see [[ZooRefs#BH97|[BH97] ]] for details.



[[ZooRefs#Bar02|[Bar02] ]] has shown the following:



If we allow a small number of advice bits (say log n), then there is a strict hierarchy: for every d at least 1, BPTIME(n^d^)/(log n) does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^)/(log n).

In the uniform setting, if [[Class_BPP|$\text{BPP}$]] has complete problems then BPTIME(n^d^) does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^).

BPTIME(n) does not equal [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].



Subsequently, [[ZooRefs#FS04|[FS04] ]] managed to reduce the number of advice bits to only 1: BPTIME(n^d^)/1 does not equal BPTIME(n^d+1^)/1.  They also proved a hierarchy theorem for HeurBPTIME.
