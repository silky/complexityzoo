= NP,,R,, - NP Over The Reals =

== Comments ==

An analog of NP for Turing machines over a real number field.

Defined in [BCS+97].

It is unknown whether P,,R,, = NP,,R,,, nor are implications known among this question, P,,C,, versus NP,,C,,, and P versus NP.

Also, in contrast to the case of NP,,C,,, it is an open problem to show that P/poly distinct from NP/poly implies P,,R,, distinct from NP,,R,,.  The difference is that in the real case, a comparison (or greater-than) operator is available, and it is not known how much power this yields in comparison to the complex case.
