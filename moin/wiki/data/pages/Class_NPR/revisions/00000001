An analog of [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] for Turing machines over a real number field.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BCS+97|[BCS+97] ]].



It is unknown whether [[Class_PR|$\text{PR}$]] = [[Class_NPR|$\text{NPR}$]], nor are implications known among this question, [[Class_PC|$\text{PC}$]] versus [[Class_NPC|$\text{NPC}$]], and [[Class_P|$\text{P}$]] versus [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]].



Also, in contrast to the case of [[Class_NPC|$\text{NPC}$]], it is an open problem to show that [[Class_P/poly|$\text{P/poly}$]] distinct from [[Class_NP/poly|$\text{NP/poly}$]] implies [[Class_PR|$\text{PR}$]] distinct from [[Class_NPR|$\text{NPR}$]].  The difference is that in the real case, a comparison (or greater-than) operator is available, and it is not known how much power this yields in comparison to the complex case.
