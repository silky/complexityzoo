== Description ==

{{{#!description

Same as [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]], except that now the verifier is given two polynomial-size quantum certificates, which are guaranteed to be unentangled.}}}

It was shown in [[ZooRefs#ABD+08|[ABD+08] ]] that a conjecture they call the Strong Amplification Conjecture implies that QMA(2) is contained in [[Class_PSPACE|$\text{PSPACE}$]]. The authors also show that there exists no perfectly disentangler that can be used to simulate QMA(2) in [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]], though other approaches to showing [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] = QMA(2) may still exist.



It was shown in [[ZooRefs#HM13|[HM13] ]] that QMA(k) = QMA(2) for k >= 2. However we still do not know if QMA(2) = [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]] and we also do not know any upper bound for QMA(2) better than [[Class_NEXP|$\text{NEXP}$]].



Defined in [[ZooRefs#KMY01|[KMY01] ]].  It is unknown whether QMA(k) = QMA(2) for all k>2, and also whether QMA(2) = [[Class_QMA|$\text{QMA}$]].
