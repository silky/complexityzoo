= QMA(2) - Quantum MA With Multiple Certificates =

== Comments ==

Same as QMA, except that now the verifier is given two polynomial-size quantum certificates, which are guaranteed to be unentangled.

Defined in [KMY01].

It was shown in [ABD+08] that a conjecture they call the Strong Amplification Conjecture implies that QMA(2) is contained in PSPACE. The authors also show that there exists no perfectly disentangler that can be used to simulate QMA(2) in QMA, though other approaches to showing QMA = QMA(2) may still exist.

It was shown in [HM13] that QMA(k) = QMA(2) for k >= 2. However we still do not know if QMA(2) = QMA and we also do not know any upper bound for QMA(2) better than NEXP.

Defined in [KMY01].  It is unknown whether QMA(k) = QMA(2) for all k>2, and also whether QMA(2) = QMA.
