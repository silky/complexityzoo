= EP - NP with 2k Accepting Paths =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that



If the answer is 'no,' then all computation paths reject.

If the answer is 'yes,' then the number of accepting paths is a power of two.



Contained in [[Class_C=P|$\text{C=P}$]], and in [[Class_ModkP|$\text{ModkP}$]] for any odd k.  Contains [[Class_UP|$\text{UP}$]].
