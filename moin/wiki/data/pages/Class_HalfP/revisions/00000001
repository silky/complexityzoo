= HalfP - RP With Exactly Half Acceptance =

== Comments ==

The class of decision problems solvable by an NP machine such that

If the answer is 'yes,' exactly 1/2 of computation paths accept.
If the answer is 'no,' all computation paths reject.

Significantly, the number of candidate witnesses is restricted to be a power of 2.  (This is implicit if they are binary strings.)

Contained in RP, EP, and Mod,,k,,P for every odd k.  Contained in EQP by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

Defined in [BB92], where it was called C,,==,,P[half].  The name used here is from [BS00].  There it was shown that HalfP is contained in every similar class in which 1/2 is replaced by some other dyadic fraction.
