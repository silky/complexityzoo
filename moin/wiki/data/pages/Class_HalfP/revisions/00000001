== Description ==

{{{#!description

The class of decision problems solvable by an [[Class_NP|$\text{NP}$]] machine such that}}}

== Comments ==



If the answer is 'yes,' exactly 1/2 of computation paths accept.

If the answer is 'no,' all computation paths reject.



Significantly, the number of candidate witnesses is restricted to be a power of 2.  (This is implicit if they are binary strings.)



Contained in [[Class_RP|$\text{RP}$]], [[Class_EP|$\text{EP}$]], and [[Class_ModkP|$\text{Mod}_\text{k}\text{P}$]] for every odd k.  Contained in [[Class_EQP|$\text{EQP}$]] by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.



Defined in [[ZooRefs#BB92|[BB92] ]], where it was called C,,==,,P[half].  The name used here is from [[ZooRefs#BS00|[BS00] ]].  There it was shown that [[Class_HalfP|$\text{HalfP}$]] is contained in every similar class in which 1/2 is replaced by some other dyadic fraction.
