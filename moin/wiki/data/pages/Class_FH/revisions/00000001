FH,,k,, is the class of problems solvable by a uniform family of polynomial-size quantum circuits, with k levels of Hadamard gates and all other gates preserving the computational basis.  (Conditional phase flip gates are fine, for example.)  Thus

FH,,0,, = P
FH,,1,, = BPP
FH,,2,, contains factoring because of Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm

It is an open problem to show that the Fourier hierarchy is infinite relative to an oracle (that is, FH,,k,, is strictly contained in FH,,k+1,,).

Defined in [Shi03].
