== Description ==

{{{#!description

The set of all problems reducible to matrix multiplication. That is, the set of problems $P$ that can be reduced to the multiplication of two square matrices can be reduced to $P$ in linear time.}}}

== Comments ==



Currently, the best known algorithm for multiplying two $n\times n$ matrices is the Coppersmithâ€“Winograd_algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(n^{2.376})$ [[ZooRefs#CW90|[CW90] ]]. Note that for the general problem, a lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ is trivial from the number of elements being considered.
